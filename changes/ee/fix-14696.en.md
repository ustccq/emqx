Address a few shortcomings in the DS Raft backend implementation:
1. Shard membership changes now proceed in rare cases where a shard replica set consists solely of replicas on sites corresponding to nodes that previously left the cluster. Refer to [Known Issues](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-docs/blob/release-5.8/en_US/changes/known-issues-5.8.md#e584) for details.
2. The _Forget site_ operation now has additional safeguards and will fail if the site is part of active shard replica sets or if its corresponding node remains in the cluster.
