Support connection rate limiting for WebSocket (WS) and WebSocket Secure (WSS) listeners. Listener configuration options `max_conn_rate` and `max_conn_burst` are now respected: incoming connections going over specified connection rate are closed immediately after being accepted, mirroring TCP listener behavior.

The `max_connections` option for WS/WSS listeners has also slightly changed: connections exceeding the limit are closed immediately after acceptance, _before_ any HTTP protocol exchange. Clients will now see an abrupt socket close instead of HTTP 429.
