Introduced enhancements to facilitate multi-tenancy in MQTT client management.

New features:

- **Multi-Tenant Client Recognition**: MQTT clients with a `tns` attribute are now treated as multi-tenant clients.
- **Namespace Indexing**: Added the MQTT client namespace (`tns`) to the client ID index to support multi-tenancy scenarios.

APIs:

- **List Namespaces**: Introduced a paginated API to retrieve namespaces:  
  Endpoint: `/api/v5/mt/ns_list`
- **List Client Sessions in a Namespace**: Added a paginated API to fetch client sessions within a specific namespace:  
  Endpoint: `/api/v5/mt/:ns/client_list`
- **Count Live Client Sessions in a Namespace**: New API to retrieve the number of active client sessions in a namespace:  
  Endpoint: `/api/v5/mt/:ns/client_count`

Configuration:

- **Session Limit Per Namespace**: Added the `multi_tenancy.default_max_sessions` configuration to enforce limits on the number of client sessions allowed per namespace.

Notes:

- Admin multi-tenancy (admin user groups) is not included in this pull request and remains under development.
