Fixed occasional warning-level log events and crashes during session expiration of WebSocket connections, introduced by recent WebSocket performance improvements. These had no impact on broker capacity, but produced log entries like the following:
* `error: {function_clause,[{gen_tcp,send,[closed,[]],[{file,“gen_tcp.erl”},{line,966}]},{cowboy_websocket_linger,commands,3,[{file,“cowboy_websocket_linger.erl”},{line,665}]},...`
* `message: {tcp,#Port<0.364>,<<136,130,...>>}, msg: emqx_session_mem_unknown_message`
