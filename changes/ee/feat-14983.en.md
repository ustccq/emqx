Added new Connector and Action that appends data to S3Tables.

### Current limitations

- Only [S3Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables.html) catalogs are supported (hence table data and metadata must live in S3).
- Only [Iceberg table format version 2](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#version-2-row-level-deletes) is supported.
- Only the following partition transform functions are supported:
  - `identity`
  - `void`
  - `bucket[N]`
- Data files are written only in [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.12.0/specification/).
