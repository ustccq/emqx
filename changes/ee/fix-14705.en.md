Improved the Kafka connectorâ€™s connectivity check to handle authentication correctly.
Previously, if Kafka required authentication but no credentials or health-check topic were configured,
the connectivity test would incorrectly pass, leading to potential action creation failures.
This fix introduces a dummy health-check topic, `emqx-connector-connectivity-probe`,
ensuring the connector is deemed healthy only if Kafka returns valid metadata or an
`unknown_topic_or_partition` response.
