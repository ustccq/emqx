Reduced the number of API calls that Kinesis Connection and Action do when (re)starting and during health checks.

Previously, upon (re)starting the Connector, it would perform one `ListStreams` request for each worker in its connection pool.  Additionally, each periodic health check would do `ListStreams` for each worker.  The Action health check would do `DescribeStream` for each connection worker in the pool.

Now, the Connector no longer performs the initial `ListStreams` upon (re)starting.  Both Connector and Action attempt to check if at least one worker has a healthy response from their respective API requests: the request is attempted by each worker serially, and the Connector or Action is considered `connected` upon the first successful response received.  Thus, in the best case scenario, each Connector and each Action will do 1 API request each per health check, regardless of pool sizea.  In the worst case scenario, each worker in the pool might still perform one request each, if they fail to receive a sucessful response.
