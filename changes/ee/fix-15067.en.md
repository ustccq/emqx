Fixed a couple of issues with Cluster Linking Route Replication.
* Replication process may enter erratic reconnect loop when the Cluster Link is misconfigured on local or remote side, which will hinder replication once misconfiguration is resolved.
* Replication process may crash during attempts to close non-existing MQTT client connection.
* Replication boostrapping may crash if shared subscriptions are present in the routing table.
