Added support to upload Protobuf source file bundles for Schema Registry.

For example, assuming that the Protobuf source file bundle is at `/tmp/bundle.tar.gz` and has the following file structure, with `a.proto` being the root Protobuf schema file:

```
.
├── a.proto
├── c.proto
└── nested
    └── b.proto
```

Then, to create a new schema using that bundle via the HTTP API:

```sh
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:18083/api/v5/schema_registry_protobuf/bundle \
  -XPOST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxx" \
  -F bundle=@/tmp/bundle.tar.gz \
  -F name=my_cool_schema \
  -F root_proto_file=a.proto
```
