Make `middlebox_comp_mode` configurable for SSL clients

The `middlebox_comp_mode` option, which was previously always enabled (`true`) for all TLS 1.3 connections, is now configurable. By default, it remains `true` to maintain compatibility with most network environments.
In rare cases where TLS fails with an error such as: "unexpected_message, TLS client: In state hello_retry_middlebox_assert ...", try set `middlebox_comp_mode` to `false`.
