Introduced NATS Gateway for accepting NATS client connections over TCP/TLS, WS/WSS transport protocols.

For example, the NATS gateway will transform the following NATS message:
```
PUB sub.t 5  
hello
```

into an MQTT message with the topic `sub/t` and payload `hello`, while supporting
seamless integration with existing EMQX features such as the rule engine, data bridging,
and more.
