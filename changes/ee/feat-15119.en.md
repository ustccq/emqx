Added a new field `sessions_hist_hwmark` to the `GET /api/v5/monitor_current response`.

This metric represents the high watermark of session history count.
- It is recorded only when the `broker.session_history_retain` configuration is set to a duration greater than `0s`.
- The highest watermark value may persist for up to 7 days before expiring.
- After expiration, the system resets, using the current session history count as the starting point, and begins recording a new high watermark and its associated timestamp.
- The expiration interval can be configured via the `dashboard.hwmark_expire_time` setting.
