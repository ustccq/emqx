When most of the Actions that use aggregated mode (Azure Blob Storage, Snowflake, S3Tables) had a delivery that failed, the following log would be printed:

```
"emqx_connector_aggreg_delivery:format_status/1 crashed"
```

This has been fixed, and more information about the delivery process will now be logged.
