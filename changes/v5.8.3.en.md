# v5.8.3

Make sure to check the breaking changes and known issues before upgrading to EMQX 5.8.3.

## Enhancements

### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#14219](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14219) Enhanced Connection Rate Limiter for Improved System Resilience.

  - **Improved system stability and responsiveness under high connection rates**: Previously, when the connection rate limit was exceeded, listener acceptors would ignore new connection attempts, potentially resulting in an unrecoverable state if a large number of clients connected or reconnected frequently within a short period. Listeners now accept pending connections but immediately close them if the rate limit is reached. This reduces resource strain and improves system resilience during peak loads.

  - **New listener option `nolinger` introduced**: When set to `true`, a TCP-RST is sent immediately upon socket closure, helping to mitigate SYN flood attacks and further enhancing connection-handling efficiency. 
  - **`max_connection` configuration for MQTT listeners now capped by system limits**: The `max_connection` value for MQTT listeners is now constrained by the system's limits (e.g., `ulimit` from the OS and `node.process_limit`). If configured to `infinity` or a value greater than the system limit, it will automatically be adjusted to match the system's maximum limit.
  - **SSL listeners' `ssl_options` now validated before changes**: Previously, invalid SSL options (such as unsupported TLS versions) could be accepted, causing client connection failures after a listener reconfiguration. With this update:
    - The node will fail to boot if a listener is configured with invalid SSL options.
    - Requests to apply invalid SSL options via the Dashboard or config API will now fail with a `400` status code.

### Configuration

- [#14195](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14195) Added support for client ID override.

  EMQX now provides greater flexibility by allowing custom client ID overrides using the `mqtt.clientid_override={Expression}` configuration. This introduces a more dynamic approach to client ID management. As part of this update, the `use_userid_as_clientid` and `peer_cert_as_clientid` options are deprecated, though they will remain available for compatibility until version 6.0.

### MQTT over QUIC

- [#14283](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14283) Improved QUIC transport, upgrade `quicer` to 0.1.9.
  - Early release of remote stream resources in the abnormal scenarios.
  - Added more troubleshooting APIs. For more details, see: https://github.com/emqx/quic/compare/0.1.6...0.1.9.

## Bug Fixes

### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#14201](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14201) Prevent `check_gc` warning from appearing when a WebSocket connection encounters a rate limit.
- [#14215](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14215) Fixed an issue where calls to the retainer (via REST or CLI) would throw an exception if it was disabled. 
- [#14223](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14223) Ensured the WebSocket close reason is returned as an atom to avoid crashes, specifically preventing the error: `error: {{case_clause,#{invalid_property_code => 51}},[{cowboy_websocket...}}`.
- [#14260](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14260) Resolved a rare race condition that could cause the connection process to crash if the CONNECT packet was not fully received before the idle timeout (default 15 seconds) expired.
- [#14268](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14268) Fixed another rare race condition that could cause the WebSocket connection process to crash when the CONNECT packet was not fully received before the idle timeout expired.
- [#14266](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14266) Updated `emqtt` from version 1.13.0 to 1.13.5. For more details, please refer to the [emqtt changelog](https://github.com/emqx/emqtt/blob/1.13.5/changelog.md).

### Durable Sessions

- [#14160](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14160) Ensured that topic matching rules for durable session subscriptions are properly applied to topics starting with the `$` symbol, in accordance with the MQTT specification.

### REST API

- [#14117](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14117) Fixed an issue in the REST API documentation where the `Users` endpoint was incorrectly listed as supporting `Basic` Authentication.

### Data Integration

- [#14172](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14172) Resolved a potential race condition where testing a connector using the HTTP API could leave lingering resources if the HTTP request timed out. 

- [#14178](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14178) Fixed an issue where configuration synchronization could become stuck on a particular node due to simultaneous deletion of rules across different nodes in the cluster.

- [#14226](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14226) Mitigated a scenario where, under high load, a node could lose track of resource metrics (e.g., action/source) and fail to recover without a restart. Now, when restarting a resource or resetting its metrics, the system attempts to recreate the lost metrics. 

  Additionally, warning logs related to metric failures, such as those for "hot-path" metrics like `matched`, are now throttled to prevent excessive log flooding. Example of throttled log:

  ```
  2024-11-14T13:56:44.134289+00:00 [warning] tag: RESOURCE, clientid: clientid, msg: handle_resource_metrics_failed, peername: 172.100.239.1:33896, reason: {badkey,matched}, stacktrace: [{erlang,map_get,[matched,#{}],[{error_info,#{module => erl_erts_errors}}]},{emqx_metrics_worker,idx_metric,4,[{file,"src/emqx_metrics_worker.erl"},{line,560}]},...
  
  2024-11-14T13:57:12.490503+00:00 [warning] msg: log_events_throttled_during_last_period, period: 1 minutes, 0 seconds, dropped: #{handle_resource_metrics_failed => 2294}
  ```

- [#14265](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14265) Fixed an issue where a `badkey` error would occur when stopping a connector if the MQTT Source action failed to subscribe successfully.
- [#14296](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14296) Prevented `ecpool_sup` from being blocked by a slow-starting `ecpool_worker`.

### Configuration

- [#14180](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14180) Fixed an issue with variform expressions returning `'undefined'` when a variable is bound to the value `undefined` or `null`. Now, an empty string is returned instead.

- [#14289](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14289) Resolved a log file path issue when importing configurations from a different environment. The `EMQX_LOG_DIR` environment variable is set to `/opt/emqx/log` in Docker but `/var/log/emqx/` when installed via RPM/DEB packages. Prior to this fix, log file paths (default file handler and audit handler) are environment-variable interpolated when being exported. This could cause crashes when importing configs into a different environment where the directory didn’t exist. 

  With this fix, log file paths are no longer environment-variable interpolated during export. Additionally, absolute log directory paths from older versions are now converted back to environment variables if the path doesn’t exist in the new environment. 

### Extension

- [#14243](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14243) Fixed an issue where the `client.connect` hook was not being triggered for some gateways.

### MQTT over QUIC

- [#14258](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14258) Reduced the QUIC connection shutdown timeout. Previously, QUIC connections had a 5-second timeout for graceful shutdown. If the client was unresponsive, EMQX would log warnings like:

  ```
  [warning] msg: session_stepdown_request_timeout, action: discard,
  ```

  or potentially cause a timeout on the Dashboard when attempting to disconnect the client. The timeout has now been reduced to 1 second for "kick" actions and 3 seconds for other scenarios.

## Breaking Changes

- [#14305](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14305) Removed support of md4, md5 and ripemd160 in authentication as they are not compliant with [NIST Secure Hash Standard](https://www.nist.gov/publications/secure-hash-standard).
