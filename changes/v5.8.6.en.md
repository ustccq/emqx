# 5.8.6

## Enhancement

- [#14869](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14869) Added the `connected_at` timestamp field to the `$events/client_disconnected` event payload. This enhancement enables tracking the original connection session time for disconnected clients, preventing outdated disconnect events from overriding newer connection states.

  Previously, when clients frequently reconnected due to unstable networks, delayed disconnect events could lead to incorrect session tracking. With this update, the `connected_at` field is now included in the event payload, aligning its behavior with system topics and ensuring accurate session state management.

## Bug Fixes

### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#14815](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14815) Fixed packet ID release for QoS 2 messages. Previously, if a client failed to send a PUBREL for the maximum configured number of pending QoS 2 messages and then disconnected, the packet IDs remained occupied even after exceeding the configured Max Awaiting PUBREL Timeout.

### Installation and Deployment

- [#14797](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14797) Fixed macOS release package startup issue due to OpenSSL dynamic linking (backport #14624).

  Previously, the EMQX ZIP package on macOS could fail to start because the `quicer` application dynamically linked to the system-installed OpenSSL, which was not signed during the EMQX build process. Now we have disabled dynamic linking for OpenSSL, aligning with the OTP shipped on macOS. This ensures EMQX starts reliably on macOS 13 and later.

### Authentication

- [#14847](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14847) Fixed JWKS authentication failure for wildcard HTTPS endpoints. Previously, JWKS authentication failed to retrieve keys from HTTPS endpoints that used wildcard hostnames, preventing successful authentication.
- [#14786](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14786) Fixed JWT authentication settings update when using an external JWKS endpoint. Previously, when updating JWT authentication settings with JWKS (key server) enabled in both the old and new configurations, some settings were not correctly applied.


### REST API

- [#14834](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14834) Fixed incorrect `Content-Type` header when downloading data backup files. Previously, the response header for downloaded backup files incorrectly used `application/json` instead of `application/octet-stream`.


### Rule Engine

- [#14824](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14824) Fixed HTTP 500 error in SQL Rule Tester when handling `details` key in alarm events. Previously, when testing `alarm_activated` or `alarm_deactivated` events in the SQL Rule Tester, certain values in the `details` key could cause an HTTP 500 error due to improper handling of nested map keys.


### Observability

- [#14800](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14800) Throttled `warning` level log `dropped_qos0_msg`.

- [#14793](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14793) Added trace log for `protocol_error` in MQTT connections.

  Previously, when a client sent invalid or unexpected MQTT packets causing a `protocol_error`, EMQX logs provided limited details, making it difficult to diagnose the issue.

  For example, if a client sent a second `CONNECT` packet while already connected, EMQX would log `socket_force_closed` with `protocol_error`, but without indicating the exact cause.

  With this update, EMQX now logs `unexpected_connect_packet` with `conn_state=connected` before `socket_force_closed`, providing clearer context for debugging protocol violations.

### Plugin

- [#14802](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14802) Introduced a new CLI command for plugins:

  ```bash
   emqx ctl plugins allow NAME-VSN
  ```

## Breaking Changes

- [#14802](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14802) Starting from this version, plugin installation via the REST API or Dashboard requires explicit permission. Users must obtain this permission using the following CLI command before installing.

  ```bash
  emqx ctl plugins allow NAME-VSN
  ```

  This change enhances security by preventing unauthorized plugin installations. Users managing plugins via the API or Dashboard must adjust their workflows accordingly.
