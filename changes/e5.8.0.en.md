# 5.8.0

*Release Date: 2024-08-28*

## Enhancements

### Cluster Linking

- [#13126](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13126) Introduced the Cluster Linking feature, which allows multiple, separate EMQX clusters to connect and communicate with each other. This feature enables efficient message exchange between clients across different clusters, even if they are geographically distributed, improving the flexibility and reach of your MQTT deployments.

### Core MQTT Functionality

- [#13009](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13009) Updated the log level for message receiving pause due to rate limiting from `debug` to `warning`. The log message `socket_receive_paused_by_rate_limit` is throttled to avoid excessive logging.

### Authentication and Authorization

- [#13350](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13350) Support for getting the Server Name of the client connected and storing it in the client information as `peersni`.

- [#12418](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12418) Enhanced JWT authentication to support claims verification using a list of objects:

  ```
  [
    {
      name = "claim_name",
      value = "${username}"
    },
    ...
  ]
  ```

  Expected values are now treated as templates, consistent with other authenticators, allowing for arbitrary expressions such as `${username}` and `${clientid}`. Previousy, only fixed `"${username}"` `"${clientid}"` values were supported for interpolation.

  Improved the documentation for the `verify_claims` parameter.

- [#13229](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13229) Added support for `${cert_pem}` placeholder in authentication templates.

- [#13324](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13324) The EMQX Dashboard can now integrate with identity services that support the OIDC protocol, such as [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), to enable OIDC-based Single Sign-On (SSO).

- [#13534](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13534) Added trace logging to indicate when the superuser bypasses the authorization check.

- [#13601](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13601) Added support for Kerberos authentication in EMQX using the GSSAPI mechanism (SASL-GSSAPI with Kerberos V5). This enhancement allows MQTT clients and servers to authenticate securely over a non-secure network using the `GSSAPI-KERBEROS` method.

### Data Integrations

- [#13144](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13144) Changed the log level to `warning` and added throttling for the log message `data_bridge_buffer_overflow` when bridge buffers overflow and messages are dropped. Previously, these events were logged at the `info` level and were not visible with the default log settings.

- [#13492](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13492) Enhanced the `GET /connectors` and `GET /connectors/:id` APIs to include lists of actions and sources that depend on a specific connector. Additionally, the `GET /actions`, `GET /sources`, `GET /actions/:id`, and `GET /sources/:id` APIs now return the list of rules associated with a specific action or source.

- [#13505](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13505) Added the ability to filter rules in the HTTP API based on the IDs of data integration actions or sources used.

- [#13506](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13506) Introduced the `peername` field to all rule engine events that already include the `peerhost` field. The `peername` field is a string formatted as `IP:PORT`.

- [#13516](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13516) Added a `direct_dispatch` argument to the `republish` action.

  When `direct_dispatch` is set to `true` (or rendered as `true` from template) the message is dispatched directly to subscribers. This feature helps prevent the triggering of additional rules or the recursive activation of the same rule.

- [#13573](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13573) Introduced `client_attrs` to the SQL context for client connectivity events and the message `publish` event.
  Users can now access client attributes within rule SQL statements, such as `SELECT client_attrs.attr1 AS attribute1`, and utilize `${attribute1}` in data integration actions.

- [#13640](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13640) Added two new SQL functions for rules: `coalesce/2` and `coalesce_ne/2`.

  These functions simplify handling null values in rule SQL expressions. For instance, instead of using:

  ```
  SELECT
    CASE
      WHEN is_null(payload.path.to.value) THEN
        0
      ELSE
        payload.path.to.value
    END AS my_value
  ```

  you can now write a more concise expression: `SELECT coalesce(payload.path.to.value, 0) AS my_value`.

- [#12959](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12959) Introduced a new option to configure a dedicated topic for health check purposes in Kafka Producer connectors. This feature enables more precise detection of connection issues with partition leaders, such as incorrect or missing credentials that could prevent establishing the connections.

- [#12961](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12961) Added a configuration option to customize group IDs in advance for Kafka Consumer sources.

- [#13069](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13069) EMQX supports the data integration with Azure Blob Storage.

- [#13199](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13199) Implemented the Message Transformation feature. This feature allows users to transform and enrich incoming messages just by using simple variform syntax, without the need to define SQL rules in the Rule Engine.

  **Example Use Case:**
  Suppose you receive a message encoded in Avro format, and you want to decode it into JSON. After decoding, you want to prepend a `tenant` attribute (retrieved from the client attributes of the publishing client) to the topic before processing the message in the Rule Engine. With this new feature, you can achieve this transformation with the following configuration:

  ```hocon
  message_transformation {
    transformations = [
      {
        name = mytransformation
        failure_action = drop
        payload_decoder = {type = avro, schema = myschema}
        payload_encoder = {type = json}
        operations = [
          {key = "topic", value = "concat([client_attrs.tenant, '/', topic])"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  This configuration specifies a transformation named `mytransformation` that:

  - **Decodes** the message payload from Avro format using a specified schema.
  - **Encodes** the payload into JSON format.
  - **Concatenates** the `tenant` attribute from client attributes with the original topic, thereby modifying the topic before further processing.

- [#13415](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13415) EMQX now supports data integration with Couchbase.

- [#13463](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13463) Enhanced the GCP PubSub Producer action to automatically retry requests when receiving HTTP status codes 502 (Bad Gateway) or 503 (Service Unavailable) from PubSub. The retries will continue until the request is successful or the message's Time-To-Live (TTL) is reached.

- [#13546](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13546) Added a configurable option for the query mode in the Pulsar Producer action, allowing users to customize how data is queried before it is sent to the Pulsar service.

- [#13650](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13650) EMQX now supports data integration with DataLayers.

### Operations

- [#13202](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13202) Introduced the `emqx_cli conf cluster_sync fix` command to address cluster configuration inconsistencies. This command synchronizes the configuration of all nodes with the configuration of the node that has the highest `tnx_id`, ensuring consistency across the cluster.

- [#13250](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13250) Added a new value for `cluster.discovery_strategy`: `singleton`.  By choosing this option, there will be effectively no clustering, and the node will reject connection attempts to and from other nodes.

- [#13370](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13370) Added a new version of `wildcard_optimized` storage layout for durable storage, offering the following improvements:

  - The new layout does not have an inherent latency.
  - MQTT messages are serialized into a more space-efficient format.

- [#13524](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13524) Added the `emqx ctl exclusive` CLI interface to manage exclusive topics more effectively. It allows administrators to better manage and troubleshoot exclusive topic subscriptions, ensuring that subscription states are accurately reflected and preventing unexpected failures.

- [#13597](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13597) Added thin wrapper functions for plugins to store and manage the certificate files used by the plugins themselves. This fix prevents plugin certificates from being inadvertently deleted by the certificate garbage collection (GC) function.

- [#13626](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13626) Added a new command `emqx ctl listeners enable <Identifier> <Bool>` to enable/disable a listener.

- [#13493](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13493) Upgraded the RPC library `gen_rpc` to version 3.4.0. This update changes the default RPC server socket option from `true` to `active-100`, which introduces back-pressure to peer nodes when the RPC server experiences heavy load. 

- [#13665](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13665) Added a new metric `emqx_actions_count` to the prometheus endpoint. It contains the number of all actions added by all rules, including Republish actions and Console Output actions.

- [#13434](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13434) Simplified `rpc` configs.
  - New config `rpc.server_port` is added to replace `rpc.tcp_server_port` and `rpc.ssl_server_port`.
  - `rpc.tcp_client_num` is renamed to `rpc.client_num` since this config is for both TCP and SSL.
  The old config names are kept as aliases for backward compatibility.

## Bug Fixes

### Core MQTT Functionality

- [#12944](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12944) Fixed an issue that caused a crash when clients with non-UTF8 client IDs attempted to connect with `strict_mode=false`.

- [#13006](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13006) Improved the validation of retained, delayed, and taken-over session messages to ensure they comply with banned client ID rules implemented through regular expression matching. Previously, certain messages, such as those delayed due to network issues or taken over by another session, could bypass the client ID bans set by regular expressions.

### Authentication and Authorization

- [#13024](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13024) Added a default ACL deny rule to reject subscriptions to the `+/#` topic pattern. Since EMQX by default rejects subscriptions to `#` topic, for completeness, it should reject `+/#` as well.

- [#13040](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13040) Improved HTTP authentication:
  * Improved error logging for cases where the HTTP `Content-Type` header is missing or unrecognized, providing more detailed information.
  * Fixed an issue causing double encoding of query parameters in authentication HTTP requests
  * Enhanced error messages when a POST method with a JSON content type is configured for authentication requests but the JSON template fails to render into valid JSON. This can occur, for example, when a template contains a placeholder like `${password}` but receives a non-UTF8 password input, leading to better transparency and easier debugging for such scenarios.

- [#13196](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13196) Added a limit to the built-in authorization database, restricting the number of Access Control List (ACL) rules per client or user to a default of 100.

- [#13584](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13584) Fixed an issue when creating HTTP authorization with empty HTTP header list.

- [#13618](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13618) Enhanced type specification for the `authorization/sources` endpoint.

- [#13624](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13624) Fixed an issue when updating rules in the built-in authorizer for a client/user could lead to the total number of rules exceeding the `max_rules` limit.

- [#13678](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13678) This fix makes the deletion of authenticator in the chain an idempotent operation, meaning, deleting a non-existing authenticator always succeeeds.

### Data Integrations

- [#13207](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13207) Improved the `republish` rule engine action to accurately reflect the success and failure of message publishing. Previously, the success metrics were incremented even when the republish action failed to deliver the message to any subscribers. Now, if the action detects that a message fails to reach any subscriber, the failure metrics are correctly incremented.

- [#13425](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13425) Improved the MQTT connector error log messages to provide clearer and more detailed information.

- [#13589](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13589) Fixed an issue where creating a rule with a null id via the HTTP API was allowed, which could lead to an inconsistent configuration.

- [#13414](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13414) Improved the RabbitMQ connector error log messages to provide clearer and more detailed information.

### File Transfer

- [#12514](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12514) Fixed the issue with the file transfer command result reporting to the `$file-response/${clientid}` channel. Previously, if a channel issued an `assemble` command and then disconnected before the assembly process finished, the status message would be lost and not sent to the response topic. Now, the assembly status is monitored by a dedicated process, ensuring the status message is reliably delivered even if the original channel disconnects.

### Operations

- [#13078](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13078) Improved validation and error handling in the EMQX Management API to ensure that requests with a JSON body include the `Content-Type: application/json` header. If the header is missing for APIs that expect JSON input, the server now correctly responds with a `415 Unsupported Media Type` status code instead of `400 Bad Request`.

- [#13225](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13225) Enhanced security in authentication and authorization APIs by redacting sensitive data such as passwords. Previously, the APIs could return the original password values in responses. With this update, sensitive information is replaced with `******` to prevent accidental exposure and protect user credentials.

### Gateways

- [#13607](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13607) Fixed an issue where the QoS level for CoAP subscriptions displayed through the API did not match the actual QoS level being used. This discrepancy could cause confusion as successful subscriptions were not accurately reflected on the Dashboard.

## Breaking Changes

- [#13080](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13080) Updated the default value of the `mqtt.retry_interval` configuration from 30 seconds to `infinity`.

  Previously, EMQX would automatically retry message deliveries every 30 seconds by default. With the new default set to `infinity`, EMQX will no longer retry message deliveries automatically. This change aligns with MQTT specification standards, which generally do not recommend in-session message delivery retries.

  We understand that some users rely on the retry feature, so the ability to configure a specific retry interval is still available for backward compatibility.

- [#13190](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13190) Discontinued support for releases on CentOS 7 and Ubuntu 18. EMQX will no longer provide builds for these operating systems due to their end-of-life status.

- [#13248](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13248) Replaced the `builtin` durable storage backend with two new backends to provide better flexibility and scalability:

  - **`builtin_local`**: A durable storage backend that does not support replication, making it suitable for single-node deployments. This backend is available in both the open-source and enterprise editions of EMQX but is not compatible with multi-node clusters.
  - **`builtin_raft`**: A durable storage backend utilizing the Raft consensus algorithm for data replication across multiple nodes. This backend is exclusively available in the enterprise edition of EMQX, providing enhanced data durability and fault tolerance.

  Additionally, several Prometheus metrics have been renamed to better reflect their functions:

  - `emqx_ds_egress_batches` has been renamed to `emqx_ds_buffer_batches`
  - `emqx_ds_egress_batches_retry` has been renamed to `emqx_ds_buffer_batches_retry`
  - `emqx_ds_egress_batches_failed` has been renamed to `emqx_ds_buffer_batches_failed`
  - `emqx_ds_egress_messages` has been renamed to `emqx_ds_buffer_messages`
  - `emqx_ds_egress_bytes` has been renamed to `emqx_ds_buffer_bytes`
  - `emqx_ds_egress_flush_time` has been renamed to `emqx_ds_buffer_flush_time`

- [#13526](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13526) Removed the Core-replicant feature from the Open-Source Edition. Starting from release 5.8, all nodes running the Open-Source Edition will operate in the Core role. This change does not impact Enterprise Edition users, who will continue to have access to the Core-replicant functionality. Additionally, the obsolete `cluster.core_nodes` configuration parameter has been removed as it is no longer needed.

- **Dashboard Updates**: The following features have been removed or restricted in the Open-Source Edition Dashboard:

  - Monitoring:
    - Delayed Publish
    - Alarms
  - Access Control:
    - Authentication (LDAP)
    - Authorization (LDAP)
    - Flapping Detect
  - Integration:
    - Flow Designer
  - Management:
    - Monitoring
    - Advanced MQTT
      - Topic Rewrite
      - Auto Subscribe
      - Delayed Publish
  - Diagnose:
    - Topic Metrics
    - Slow Subscriptions

- [#13372](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13372) Now the number of connections accepted by gateways is governed by the licensing terms, ensuring compliance with the allowed connection limits.
