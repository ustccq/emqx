# v5.8.5

## Enhancements

### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#14454](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14454) Introduced `max_publish_rate` option for the retainer. The option controls the maximum allowed rate of publishing retained messages in each node. Any messages published beyond this limit will still be delivered but will not be stored as retained.

  This option is useful to limit the load on the configured retained message storage.

- [#14456](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14456) Introduced a simple firewall script, `bin/emqx_fw`, to protect EMQX listeners from SYN flooding attacks. This feature is available for Linux only.

- [#14496](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14496) Added extra validation for the `root_keys` parameters in `POST /data/export` API. Now, invalid root keys will result in an error instead of being silently ignored.

### Access Control

- [#14494](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14494) Enhanced MongoDB authorization with support for complex queries.

  - Added support for the top-level `$orderby` operator in selector filter configuration, enabling sorting of query results in authorization checks.
  - Introduced `skip` and `limit` options for better pagination and control over query results in MongoDB-based authorization.

- [#14570](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14570) Added support for using placeholders in HTTP Headers for HTTP Authentication and Authorization configurations.

- [#14665](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14665) Added support for client attributes as ACL rule pre-conditions. You can now create ACL rules based on client attributes, allowing more fine-grained control over access.

  For example, the following rule allows clients with a `"type"` attribute set to `"internal"` to publish or subscribe to all topics: 

  `{allow, {client_attr, "type", "internal"}, all, ["#"]}.` 

  And the rule below denies clients with a `"type"` attribute prefixed with `"external-"` from publishi any messages:

  `{deny, {client_attr, "type", {re, "external-.*"}}, publish, ["#"]}.`

### Rule Engine

- [#14627](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14627) Added two new rule engine events: `$events/sys/alarm_activated` and `$events/sys/alarm_deactivated`. These are triggered when system alarms are activated and deactivated.

### Data Integration

- [#14404](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14404) Added support for specifying static clientids for MQTT Connector.
- [#14450](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14450) Added support for setting `no-local` flag to MQTT Source. The `no-local` flag can now be configured in MQTT Source settings to prevent messages published by a client from being received by that same client.
- [#14507](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14507) Added two new lightweight HTTP APIs: `GET /actions_summary` and `GET /sources_summary`. These new APIs provide a more concise overview of actions and sources, similar to the existing `GET /actions` and `GET /sources` APIs, but without returning the full configurations of the entities, making them faster and less resource-intensive.

### Observability

- [#14437](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14437) Added two new gauges to Prometheus output: `emqx_vm_mnesia_tm_mailbox_size` and `emqx_vm_broker_pool_max_mailbox_size`. These gauges track the mailbox sizes of internal EMQX processes that can indicate system overload. Additionally, alarms will be raised when mailbox sizes surpass certain high watermarks.
- [#14645](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14645) Added more log messages to help debug fetching Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) for the first time (before they are cached and refreshed automatically). Successes and failures are logged at `debug` and `warning` levels, respectively.
- [#14656](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14656) Enhanced Prometheus push to support more metrics and allow the cluster name to be used as a variable name for the Job label.

### MQTT over QUIC

- [#14583](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14583) The QUIC listener now supports dumping TLS secrets to the `SSLKEYLOGFILE` environment variable, enabling tools like Wireshark to decrypt live or captured QUIC traffic. This allows for decoding MQTT packets within the QUIC traffic.

  Example configuration:
  `EMQX_LISTENERS__QUIC__DEFAULT__SSLKEYLOGFILE=/tmp/EMQX_SSLKEYLOGFILE`

  Note: This is a hidden configuration intended for troubleshooting purposes only.

- [#14597](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14597) Asynchronous abort stream read during connection termination.

  In scenarios where a session is "taken over", "discarded", or "kicked", the previous connection termination process involved a graceful stream shutdown. This could result in blocking delays of up to 3 seconds if the old client was unresponsive.

  This issue occurred because graceful shutdown relies on cooperative signaling between both endpoints, ensuring the MQTT.DISCONNECT packet is delivered to the peer before the transport is closed. If the peer was unresponsive, this approach caused unnecessary delays.

  With this improvement, the stream is now half-closed during termination. The read (recv) operation aborted, while the write (send) operation remains open. This adjustment ensures that the MQTT.DISCONNECT packet is still delivered to the peer, properly signaling the shutdown, without unnecessary delays. 

  **Benefits**:

  - Reduces blocking times when the peer is unreachable or unresponsive.
  - Maintains proper notification of the termination process to the peer, improving the overall connection shutdown behavior.
  - Reduces the latency in the session takeover sand the clean-start scenarios (e.g, discard).

## Bug Fixes

### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#14405](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14405) Converted `256MB` to `268435455` bytes for `mqtt.max_packet_size`.

  EMQX previously allowed setting `256MB` for `mqtt.max_packet_size` config, which is in fact one byte more than what the protocol specification allows. For backward compatibility, `mqtt.max_packet_size=256MB` is still allowed from configurations but will be silently converted to `268435455`.

- [#14508](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14508) Improved the EMQX performance when large numbers of clients reconnect.

- [#14608](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14608) Enforced First-In-First-Out (FIFO) semantics in MQTT session message queue. The MQTT session message queue now strictly follows FIFO semantics when it reaches its capacity. When the queue is full, the oldest message will be dropped first.

- [#14609](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14609) Corrected high memory threshold for overload protection to use `sysmon.os.sysmem_high_watermark`. The high memory threshold is now properly updated during the boot process or whenever `sysmon.os.sysmem_high_watermark` is changed. This ensures the memory overload protection threshold is dynamic and reflects changes to the system memory settings.

- [#14654](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14654) Clients can now reconnect successfully even if the maximum session limit has been reached, as long as their previous sessions remain active (i.e., not expired or cleaned up).

- [#14588](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14588) Improved memory usage reporting when EMQX runs in a containerized environment. In containerized environments like Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (AWS EKS), the accuracy of memory usage readings can be influenced by factors such as the host kernel version, cgroup version, and how the container management service mounts cgroupfs. This update improves the accuracy of memory usage reporting when EMQX runs in AWS EKS, specifically addressing discrepancies caused by the container environment.

### Authentication

- [#14585](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14585) Fixed an issue where password hash comparisons were case-sensitive, which could lead to authentication failures, especially when integrating with external systems that may store passwords with different case conventions. Now, password hashes will be compared in a case-insensitive manner, improving compatibility and reliability when EMQX authenticates users against external sources.

### Gateway

- [#14484](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14484) Fixed an issue where the Exproto gateway did not support using hostname in the server endpoint.

- [#14489](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14489) Fixed issue where accessing the `api/v5/gateways` endpoint resulted in a 500 error if the gateway was not enabled on the node in the cluster. Now, such requests return a more appropriate response, preventing crashes and improving the stability of the API in these scenarios.

- [#14501](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14501) Fixed issue where the gateway client query HTTP API always returned a keepalive value of 0. The correct keepalive value is now returned by the HTTP API, and the gateway adheres to the configured idle timeout, properly reflecting the client's heartbeat settings.

- [#14503](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14503) Returns an empty list instead of a 404 error if no listener exists at the gateway. Previously, when accessing the listeners page of a gateway (such as LwM2M) through the API, a 404 error would be returned if no listeners were configured. This fix changes the behavior to return an empty list when no listeners exist.

- [#14511](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14511) Eliminated unnecessary log printing by the Stomp gateway when client authentication fails.

- [#14653](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14653) Fixed stomp gateway keepalive behavior. Previously, the STOMP connection's heartbeat mechanism would fail to keep the connection alive if the heartbeat packet was received slightly after the check timer. This update introduces tolerance for minor delays, ensuring that the connection will stay alive. On average, the connection closure now occurs at approximately 1.5 times the heartbeat interval, providing more reliable keepalive functionality.

### Data Integration

- [#14518](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14518) This update ensures that Connectors are now started asynchronously when loading from configuration, whether via CLI or HTTP API. Previously, if a connector hung during startup, it could cause the entire configuration import process to time out.

  Additionally, connectors are now started asynchronously when (re)starting a node, resulting in faster boot-up times. This release also fixes a potential issue where a Source could be added to the configuration before its corresponding Connector, ensuring correct initialization order during configuration import.

- [#14550](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14550) Fixed an issue where MQTT clients in the connection pool of an MQTT Connector would fail to reconnect automatically if only a few clients were disconnected. The fix ensures clients are automatically reconnected when disconnected, improving connection reliability.

- [#14555](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14555) Fixed an issue with MQTT Source where shared topics were not properly unsubscribed from when a source was removed or updated.

- [#14671](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14671) Fixed an issue in MQTT Action. Before the fix, messages could fail to be sent or retried due to a rare race condition when the MQTT Connector's connection was closed. This update ensures that TCP connection closures (`tcp_closed`) and client disconnections are handled as recoverable errors.

- [#14695](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14695) Improved HTTP API error messages when attempting to update a Connector and a validation error occurs.

- [#14697](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14697) Fixed a problem in which, when a Source and an Action shared the same name and used the same connector, one could not delete the Action or Source if there were rule dependencies on the dual Source/Action.

### Clustering

- [#14536](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14536) Fixed rare race condition in cluster management operations. Before the fix, the race condition caused certain cluster management operations to hang, making cluster changes impossible until a node restarts. This issue was addressed by tightening the global lock guarding `mria:join/1` operations. The stricter locking prevents concurrent joins from interfering with each other.

- [#14548](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14548) Fixed an issue where a node would crash during reboot if a new node joined the cluster while it was down, resulting in a `** FATAL ** Failed to merge schema: {aborted,function_clause}` error. This fix ensures that nodes can now restart smoothly without requiring a rejoin to the cluster.

- [#14662](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14662) Fixed an issue where a running replicant node, after rejoining a cluster in which all core nodes had their internal databases wiped, would fail to participate in certain Remote Procedure Call (RPC) call operations.

### Administration

- [#14543](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14543) Fixed an internal compatibility issue that caused certain ExHooks to crash when clients were connected through WS, WSS, or Gateway listeners.

## Breaking changes

- [#14703](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14703) Introduced a change to the maximum allowed value for `force_shutdown.max_heap_size`, which is now set to `128GB`. If the `max_heap_size` was previously set to a value exceeding 128GB, this could lead to issues after upgrading, such as during configuration reloading or updates.
