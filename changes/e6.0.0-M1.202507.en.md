# e6.0.0-M1.202507

## Enhancements

- [#15176](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15176) Upgrade the GreptimeDB connector client and support an optional new parameter `ttl` to set the default time-to-live for automatically created tables.

- [#15294](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15294) Enhance LDAP authentication and authorization.
  LDAP authorization now supports extended ACL rules in JSON format.
  LDAP authenticaton now can fetch ACL rules from LDAP. These rules are cached in the client's metadata, so authorization is performed without additional LDAP queries.

- [#15349](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15349) Optimize external resource management for authentication and authorization. Previously, EMQX could remain connected to a resource configured for a disabled authentication or authorization provider.

- [#15360](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15360) Added support for writing data files in Parquet format for S3Tables Action.

- [#15364](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15364) Add HTTP header configuration items to the OpenTelemetry integration to adapt to collectors with HTTP authentication.

- [#15371](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15371) Added `tags` fields to the return of `GET /actions_summary` and to the fallback actions returned in `GET /actions/:id`.

- [#15387](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15387) Improved Kinesis Producer Connector and Action health checks to mitigate the occurrence of rate limiting when calling `ListStreams` and `DescribeStream` APIs.  Now, we limit the the calls per Connector to such APIs to 5/s and 10/s, respectively.  If a Connector or Action cannot call their health check API before timing out, they will simply maintain their current status.  If they receive a throttling response (e.g.: `LimitExceededException`), they will also maintain their current status.

  Introduced a new `resource_opts.health_check_interval_jitter` configuration to add an uniform random delay to `resource_opts.health_check_interval`, so that multiple Actions under the same Connector will seldom run their health checks simultaneously.

- [#15399](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15399) Now, `node_dump` will export the current system configuration in HOCON format with redacted secrets.

- [#15401](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15401) Added support for Snowpipe Streaming upload mode for Snowflake Action.  Note: this is currently a preview feature by Snowflake, and support for it is available to all accounts on AWS only.

- [#15418](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15418) Added new Connector and Action that appends data to BigQuery.

- [#15467](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15467) Expose transport options for AI Completion Providers.
  These options allow configuring connection timeouts and maximum connections to an AI Completion Provider.

## Bug Fixes

- [#15342](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15342) Fixed NATS gateway crash when clientinfo override templates contain undefined packet fields by returning empty binary instead of undefined atom.

- [#15361](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15361) Fixed a function clause error when parsing a malformed `User-Property` pair where the pair length is wrong (too short).

- [#15394](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15394) Fixed a very rare race condition in which Action metrics could end up in an inconsistent state.

- [#15396](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15396) Removed redundant cleanup operations for shared subscriptions of disconnected clients, which were prone to crashes under high disconnect volume, resulting in potential inconsistencies in the global broker state.

- [#15416](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15416) Fixed occasional warning-level log events and crashes during session expiration of WebSocket connections, introduced by recent WebSocket performance improvements. These had no impact on broker capacity, but produced log entries like the following:
  * `error: {function_clause,[{gen_tcp,send,[closed,[]],[{file,“gen_tcp.erl”},{line,966}]},{cowboy_websocket_linger,commands,3,[{file,“cowboy_websocket_linger.erl”},{line,665}]},...`
  * `message: {tcp,#Port<0.364>,<<136,130,...>>}, msg: emqx_session_mem_unknown_message`

- [#15476](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15476) When most of the Actions that use aggregated mode (Azure Blob Storage, Snowflake, S3Tables) had a delivery that failed, the following log would be printed:

  ```
  "emqx_connector_aggreg_delivery:format_status/1 crashed"
  ```

  This has been fixed, and more information about the delivery process will now be logged.

- [#15518](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15518) Resolve a race condition that may lead to accumulating inconsistencies in the routing table and shared subscriptions state in the cluster when a large number of shared subscribers disconnect simultaneously.

- [#15522](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15522) Fixed an issue where Snowflake Connector would fail to start correctly is `username` was not provided.
