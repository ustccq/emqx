# 5.8.1

*Release Date: 2024-10-14*

Make sure to check the breaking changes and known issues before upgrading to EMQX 5.8.1.

## Important Changes

- [#13956](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13956) Updated the `gen_rpc` library to version 3.4.1, which includes a node crash issue.
Previously, if a node is force shutdown down while RPC channels are being established, it may cause a cluster peer node to crash.

## Enhancements

### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#13525](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13525) Added new configuration item `shared_subscription_initial_sticky_pick` to specify the strategy for making the initial pick when `shared_subscription_strategy` is set to `sticky`.

- [#13942](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13942) The HTTP client now automatically reconnects if no activity is detected for 10 seconds after the latest request has expired.
  Previously, it would wait indefinitely for a server response, causing timeouts if the server dropped requests.

  This change impacts below components.

  - HTTP authentication
  - HTTP authorization
  - Webhook (HTTP connector)

### Authentication and Authorization

- [#13863](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13863) EMQX now supports `${cert_common_name}` placeholder in topic name templates for raw ACL rules.

- [#13792](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13792) The banned-clients API `GET /banned` supports querying the rules using filters in the query string.

  The available filters are:

  - clientid
  - username
  - peerhost
  - like_clientid
  - like_username
  - like_peerhost
  - like_peerhost_net

  When adding a new banned client entry, the default expiration time for entries without the `until` parameter specified has been changed from 1 year to `infinite`.

### Rule Engine

- [#13773](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13773) Disabled rule actions now do not trigger `out_of_service` warnings.

  Previously, if an action is disabled, there would be a warning log with `msg: out_of_service`,
  and the `actions.failed` counter was incremented for the rule.

  After this enhancement, disabled action will result in a `debug` level log with `msg: discarded`,
  and the newly introduced counter `actions.discarded` will be incremented.

### MQTT over QUIC

- [#13814](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13814) Connection Scope Keepalive for MQTT over QUIC Multi-Stream:

  This update introduces a new feature to maintain MQTT connections over QUIC multi-streams, even when the control stream is idle but other data streams are active.

  Previously, clients had to send `MQTT.PINGREQ` on idle control streams to keep the connection alive. Now, a shared state is maintained for each connection, monitoring activity across all streams. This shared state helps determine if the connection is still active, reducing the risk of keepalive timeouts caused by Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking and improving overall connection stability.

### Deployment

- [#13711](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13711) Added an option to specify custom `podLabels` when deploying via Helm chart.

## Bug Fixes

### Core MQTT Functions

- [#13702](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13702) Clean up the corresponding exclusive subscriptions when a node goes down.

- [#13708](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13708) Fixed an issue which may cause shared subscription 'sticky' strategy to degrade to 'random'.

- [#13733](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13733) Made `cacertfile` optional when configuring https listener from `emqx ctl conf load` command.

- [#13742](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13742) Fixed when subscribing with `+` as the first level, or `#` as a wildcard, retained messages with topics starting with `$` are incorrectly received.

- [#13754](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13754) Fixed an issue when websocket connection would break consistently on its own.

- [#13756](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13756) Introduced more randomness to broker assigned client IDs.

- [#13790](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13790) The default heartbeat interval for the MQTT connector has been reduced from 300 seconds to 160 seconds.

  This change helps maintain the underlying TCP connection by preventing timeouts due to the idle limits
  imposed by load balancers or firewalls, which typically range from 3 to 5 minutes depending on the cloud provider.


- [#13832](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13832) Fixed that the `Publish` endpoint would have a 500 error when persistent session were enabled.

- [#13842](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13842) Fixed a UTF-8 string validation exception.

### Upgrade and Migration

- [#13731](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13731) Resolved an issue that prevented clusters running on EMQX 5.4.0 from upgrading to EMQX 5.8.0. This fix introduces a migration procedure to update specific internal database tables created in version 5.4.0 to align with the new schema.

## Breaking Changes

- [#13792](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13792) The default expiration time for a banned item that is created without an `until` value is now `infinity` (previsouly capped at 1 year limit).

- [#13742](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/13742) Fixed an issue when a client would receive retained messages for a topic starting with `$` when it subscribed to topic `#` or `+`.

  This fix satisfies the requirement of [MQTT-4.7.2-1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/mqtt/mqtt/v5.0/os/mqtt-v5.0-os.html#_Toc3901246).
