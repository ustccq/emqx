# e5.9.0

*Release Date: 2025-05-02*

## Enhancements

### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#14721](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14721) Delayed publish interval limit changed from 4294967 seconds (49.7 days) to 42949670 seconds (497 days).

- [#14595](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14595) Deprecate `retainer.enable` flag. Retainer starts and stops automatically based on the `mqtt.retain_available` flag in zone configurations.

### Installation and Deployment

- [#14930](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14930) Start releasing macOS 15 (Sequoia) packages.
- [#14590](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14590) Limit the maximum uptime for a node running under evaluation license to one month. After reaching the uptime limit, the node will reject new connections.

### Namespace

- [#14261](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14261) Introduced enhancements to facilitate namespace in MQTT client management.

  **New features**:

  - Namespace Client Recognition: MQTT clients with a `tns` attribute are now treated as namespace clients.
  - Namespace Indexing: Added the MQTT client namespace (`tns`) to the client ID index to support multi-tenancy scenarios.

  **APIs**:

  - List Namespaces: Introduced a paginated API to retrieve namespaces:
    Endpoint: `/api/v5/mt/ns_list`
  - List Client Sessions in a Namespace: Added a paginated API to fetch client sessions within a specific namespace:
    Endpoint: `/api/v5/mt/:ns/client_list`
  - Count Live Client Sessions in a Namespace: New API to retrieve the number of active client sessions in a namespace:
    Endpoint: `/api/v5/mt/:ns/client_count`

  **Configuration**:

  - Session Limit Per Namespace: Added the `multi_tenancy.default_max_sessions` configuration to enforce limits on the number of client sessions allowed per namespace.

  Notes:

  - Admin namespace (admin user groups) is not included in this pull request and remains under development.

- [#14884](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14884) Added HTTP API to manage Namespace configurations.

- [#14840](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14840) Added HTTP API endpoints to configure client and tenant rate limiters for Namespace feature.


### Authentication and Authorization

- [#14584](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14584) Added support authenticator app for Dashboard 2FA (2-factor authentication) login.

- [#14979](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14979) Added support for `zone` and `listener` in authentication and authorization templates.
  Also added `zone` and `listener` to the `who` match conditions in ACL rules.

  This enables per-listener or per-zone access control.
  Examples:

  - Send the `zone` name in requests to the HTTP authenticator using a body template like:
    `{"username": "${username}", "zone": "${zone}"}`

  - In `acl.conf`, allow clients to subscribe to `${username}/#` only if connected via the SSL listener:
    `{allow, {listener, "ssl:default"}, subscribe, ["${username}/#"]}.`

- [#14976](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14976) Added support for the precondition configuration for authenticators.

  This allows selective invocation of authenticators based on client information, helping avoid unnecessary authentication requests.
  For example, to trigger the HTTP authenticator only for clients connected via `tcp:default`, and Postgre authenticators for those on `ssl:default`, you can use preconditions like str_eq(listener, 'tcp:default') or str_eq(listener, 'ssl:default').

- [#14966](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14966) Added the possibility of deleting the default Dashboard admin user.  For that, at least one other admin user must exist.

- [#14358](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14358) Limit variables used in LDAP authentication/authorization templates to the ones that are allowed in the other authentication/authorization sources. The unsupported variables are kept unrendered.

- [#14610](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14610) Handle additional fields in authorization rules fetched from the external sources or stored in the built-in database.

  The new supported fields are:

  `username_re`: A regex for filtering rules by username. 

  `clientid_re`: A regex for filtering rules by clientid. 

  `ipaddr`: An IP address/mask for filtering rules by IP address.

  A rule is applied only if all the present filters match.

- [#14329](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14329) Made `${peerport}` variable available for use in templates of external requests made by authentication and authorization.

- [#14286](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14286) Implemented node-level cache for authorization and authentication.

  Some authentication and authorization methods require an external service to be called. This may result in excessive load on EMQX and the external service, especially when clients reconnect frequently.

  This feature provides a way to enable node-level caching for such authentication and authorization methods. Caching is available for the authnetication and authorization backends with the following mechanisms:

  - HTTP
  - LDAP
  - MongoDB
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  - Redis

### REST API

- [#14254](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14254) Return cluster name in `/status` HTTP endpoint.
- [#14972](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14972) Implemented API methods for downloading/uploading individual plugin configs.
- [#15013](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15013) Added a new `action_details` field to the rule information returned by Rule Engine HTTP APIs.  This new fields contains the type, name and status of actions referenced by each rule.
- [#14735](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14735) Added a `last_modified_at` field to rule information in Rule Engine HTTP APIs.

### Clustering

- [#14766](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14766) Added safeguards to `emqx ctl cluster leave` command to prevent nodes responsible for Durable Storage data replication from leaving the cluster.

- [#14040](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14040) Added timeouts to the internal RPC calls during node rebalance. Previously, the rebalance process could hang if a node was unresponsive.

- [#14892](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14892) Enhanced cluster load rebalancing:
  
     - Fixed load imbalance in core/replicant cluster. Previously, under certain conditions, all transactions from the replicants could be sent to a single core node.
      
  - Add CLI commands for rebalancing replicant nodes in relation to core nodes:
    - `emqx_ctl cluster core rebalance plan`
  
    - `emqx_ctl cluster core rebalance status`

       - `emqx_ctl cluster core rebalance confirm`
    
       - `emqx_ctl cluster core rebalance abort`
  
- [#14907](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14907) Improved stability of node evacuation. Previously, the evacuation could enter a dead loop and require manual intervention to recover.

### Data Integration

- [#14118](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14118) Support `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` in Mysql actions.

  Now the user can specify `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` in the `mysql` action, e.g.:

  ```
  INSERT INTO t1 (a,b,c) VALUES (${id},${clientid},${qos}) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE a=a;
  ```

  Note that the `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` clause doesn't support placeholders (`${var}`).

- [#14629](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14629) Added support for [JSON Lines](https://jsonlines.org/) container types for S3 and Azure Blob Storage Actions.

- [#14642](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14642) Added new Connector and Action types that allow logging events to local disk in JSON lines format.

- [#14996](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14996) RabbitMQ action supports using the default exchange.

- [#14901](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14901) Added a new type of schema to Schema Registry: `external_http`.  With this new schema type, it's possible to setup an external HTTP server that performs arbitrary operations to the payload and return the result to be used in Rules.

- [#14722](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14722) Added a new `connect_timeout` option to MQTT Connector. This controls how long in seconds the connection process is allowed to be stuck waiting to establish connection. Lower values may improve connection problem feedback times.

- [#14615](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14615) Added support for configuring the `max_inactive` parameter for several integrations that utilize the `ehttpc` HTTP driver.

- [#14459](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14459) Added support for Fallback Actions.

  These are triggered when a message fails to be successfully processed by a Data Integration Action, including when it's dropped due to buffer overflow or to its time to live being reached. They can be configured for all Data Integration Actions.

  Sample configuration snippet for a Kafka Action:

  ```
  actions.kafka_producer.my_action {
    fallback_actions = [
      {kind = reference, type = mqtt, name = mqtt_fallback_publisher},
      {kind = republish, args = {topic = "fallback/action/republish"}}
    ]
    # ...
  }
  ```

- [#14582](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14582) Avoid pre- and post-processing of internal JSON representation before serialization and after deserialization respectively, in cases where it is completely unnecessary.

### Administration

- [#14845](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14845) Avoid unnecessary restarts of existing listeners when changing gateway configurations and listeners.

- [#14773](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14773) Improved rate-limiting functionality (`bytes_rate`, `messages_rate`, `max_conn_rate` configured for zones or listeners).

  - The rate-limiting algorithm is simplified to work more predictably. It does not try to impose backpressure on the client(s). Instead, it drops the messages. For QoS1/QoS2 messages the appropriate reason code is also returned.
  - Rate limiting now allows reconfiguration at runtime.
  - Rate limiting configuration now allows to specify window size and limit per each window explicitly: `messages_rate = "300/5m"` means 300 messages per 5 minutes (with any possible fluctuation within this period), while `messages_rate = "10/10s"` means 10 messages per 10 seconds. Although the configured RPS is the same, the latter variant is much more strict about fluctuations in the actual rate.
  - Burst rate is provided via the `messages_burst`, `bytes_burst`, `max_conn_burst` zone and listener options. The burst value `messages_burst = 1000/h` means a client can send 1000 additional messages each hour without applying rate limiting.
- [#14341](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14341) This enhancement allow the namespace feature to support per-namespace session count limit. It support `quota_exceeded` error reason from `client.authenticate` hook point callback.
- [#14679](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14679) Updated the `exhook.proto` to v3 for passing `User-Property` parameters in the OnMessagePublish callback.
- [#14963](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14963) Provide plugins with the ability health status with the new `on_health_check/1` callback.
  Export health status via HTTP API and CLI.

### Dashboard

- [#14750](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14750) In the Dashboard, fixed displaying the "Shared Subscriptions" value. Previously, an outdated value may appear.
- [#14638](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14638) Added support for using file secrets (i.e.: `file://...`) to define the Dashboard default password.
- [#14255](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14255) Introduced a password expiration mechanism for Dashboard users.
- [#15014](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15014) Dashboard security improved.
  The ability to log into the dashboard is blocked for a period after several unsuccessful attempts.
  The number of attempts and lock duration can be configured.

### Observability

- [#14794](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14794) Added the `payload_limit` parameter to the HTTP API interface for the Log Trace. Previously, the payload print would be truncated if its size exceeded 1024 bytes. Now, this limit is configurable.
  
- [#14876](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14876) End-to-end tracing support for Rule Engine, including tracing for the following entry:

  - Client-published messages triggering Rules
  - Client events and alert events triggering Rules
  - Source-triggered Rules
  - Actions executed by Rules

  Limitations:
  Fallback action tracing is not currently supported.

- [#14723](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14723) Add `method` option to the Prometheus Push Gateway configuration. Before this change, the default value was `post`. Now, it is `put`.

  The `put` method is used to replace the metrics of the same job in Pushgateway to avoid the metrics being retained in Pushgateway after being removed from the emqx cluster.

  See the [PUT method](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway?tab=readme-ov-file#put-method) for more details.

- [#14636](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14636) The `packets.publish.dropped` metric has been deprecated and replaced with two new, more meaningful metrics:

  - `messages.dropped.quota_exceeded`: Triggered when a client exceeds its configured rate limit, such as the allowed number of QoS 0 messages.
  - `messages.dropped.receive_maximum`: Triggered when the session reaches its Receive Maximum limit while publishing QoS 2 messages.

  These new metrics provide more precise insight into why messages are dropped under different conditions.

- [#14540](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14540) Introduced configurable latency measurement for authentication and authorization. Metrics are exposed as Prometheus histograms.

- [#14264](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14264) Added a timestamp to the crash_dump file to ensure that it is not overwritten by the next crash dump.

- [#15119](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15119) Added a high-watermark metric for the session registry table size, showing the peak number of active sessions. This metric is displayed on the Dashboard Overview page to help monitor session resource usage.

- [#15117](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15117) Refined the warning log for cinfo authentication expression evaluation failures, making it more concise, and less likely to be mistaken for a crash.

  Old log example:

  ```
  2025-04-25T13:15:59.993395+00:00 [warning] tag: AUTHN, clientid: mqttx_a50058aa, msg: authenticator_error, peername: 127.0.0.1:60842, 
  reason: {case_clause,{error,#{error => #{reason => var_unbound,var_name => <<"cert_common_name">>},
  cause => "clientinfo_auth_expression_evaluation_error"}}}, 
  stacktrace: [{emqx_authn_cinfo,do_check,2,[{file,"emqx_authn_cinfo.erl"},{line,94}]},{emqx_authn_cinfo,check,2,[{file,"emqx_authn_cinfo.erl"},{line,82}]},{emqx_authn_chains,authenticate_with_provider,2,...
  ```

  New log example:

  ```
  2025-04-25T15:46:50.748732+02:00 [warning] clientid: client1, 
  msg: clientinfo_auth_expression_evaluation_error, 
  peername: 127.0.0.1:53919, 
  reason: #{reason => var_unbound,var_name => <<"cert_common_name">>}
  ```


### CLI

- [#14691](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14691) Added the possibility of filtering which data to be exported to the CLI command `emqx ctl data export`. It's now possible to specify which root keys from the `cluster.hocon` file and which table sets are exported, in the same vein as how `POST /data/export` works.

### Configuration File

- [#14647](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14647) `cluster.hocon` backups are now made at a configurable interval. Instead of create a backup for each single config update operation, now we collect several changes before backing the file up, reducing the number of such backups.

### Plugin and Extension

- [#14957](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14957) Enhanced plugin configuration update handling:
  - Added support for respecting the `on_config_changed` callback response for plugins. This ensures that when the configuration of a plugin is updated, the plugin’s callback is properly called to handle the change, even for stopped plugins.
  - Introduced a new method for updating plugin configurations that respects the result of the `on_config_changed` callback.

### Gateway

- [#14017](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14017) Support for parsing customized types of InfoReport data messages in the GB/T 32960 gateway.

### MQTT over QUIC

- [#14431](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14431) Switched to newer QUIC stack: quicer 0.2.3:

  - msquic 2.3.8 + patches

  - Advance resource management

  - Prepared to support more dynamic config changes on the listeners

### System Upgrade

- [#14639](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14639) EMQX is now released on Erlang/OTP 27.

## Bug Fixes

### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#14707](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14707) Fixed an issue where, in strict_mode, PUBLISH packets with QoS 2 and the DUP flag set were incorrectly considered invalid packets.

- [#14192](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14192) Allowed will messages to be sent by the clients that disconnect because of authentication/authorization expiration. Previously, such clients could not send a will message because the sending occurred just after the authorization expiration, so the message could not pass the authorization rules.

- [#14122](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14122) Fixed handling of `PUBACK` and `PUBREC`/`PUBCOMP` when the published message has QoS 2 and 1, repectively.

  Prior to this fix, the broker would accept `PUBACK` and `PUBREC`/`PUBCOMP` packets from clients referencing packet identifiers that corresponded to messages with QoS 2 and 1, respectively. Now, the broker will disconnect clients that behave like this.

- [#15106](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15106) Fixed a bug where duplicated `clientid` values were being returned by the `GET api/v5/clients_v2` API. This issue occurred due to the accidental resurrection of `chaninfo` events, causing unexpected client data duplication. The fix ensures that such events do not inadvertently affect the client list, resolving the issue where clients appeared as duplicated on the client page.

- [#14906](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14906) Updated Mria to 0.8.12.1 to eliminate occasional warnings caused by unexpected exit signals.

  ```
  2025-01-10T20:00:00+00:00 [warning] clientid: C1, msg: emqx_session_mem_unknown_message, message: {'EXIT',<0.123456.0>,normal}
  ```


- [#15084](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15084) Client attributes `zone` and `listener` can be used as various string function input.

  Previously functions like `regex_match` would raise exception because `zone` and `listener` are internally atoms.

### Installation

- [#14624](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14624) Fixed macOS release package dynamic linking openssl.e

  EMQX zip package may fail to start on macOS because quicer application dynamic links to sys installed openssl which is not signed by EMQX build process.

  Now we change to disabled dynamic linking as the OTP we shipped on macOS also disabled dynamic linking of openssl.

### REST API

- [#14771](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14771) Fixed an issue where the number of results that the `GET /clients_v2` HTTP API returned could exceed the requested limit.

  Note: while performing a rolling upgrade, this API may not list all existing clients until all nodes are migrated. As a workaround, if HTTP API requests are issued to old core nodes, all clients can be listed before all nodes are fully upgraded.

- [#14182](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14182) Previously, if a delayed message was published via the `POST /publish` HTTP API, a 202 reponse with the reason code 16 ("no matching subscribers") would be returned. Now, a 200 response is sent along with the message identifier.

### MQTT Durable Sessions

- [#14674](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14674) Limit number and size of RocksDB info log files created by EMQX durable storage.
- [#14498](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14498) Improved performance of durable sessions:
  - Idle durable sessions no longer consume CPU cycles.
  - Fixed QoS upgrade feature: subscribers will no longer receive messages with QoS higher than QoS of the subscription when feature is enabled.

- [#14933](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14933) Resolved a rare edge case where a Durable Storage backed by DS Raft could be assigned to storage sites that had left the cluster long ago.

### Authentication and Authorization

- [#14777](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14777) Fixed settings update for JWT authentication. Previously, some fields may be not updated correctly for a configuration with external JWKS endpoint.

- [#14556](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14556) Fixed rarely possible false positive authentication while the node is starting or shutting down.

- [#15059](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15059) Fixed the reaction to updating the Redis authentication config with invalid values.

  Previously, the authenticator could crash and stop being applied during authentication.
  Now, proper errors are provided to the user and the update is denied.

- [#14303](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14303) Resolved an issue with broken `scram:http` authentication. The request sent to the HTTP connector was malformed, causing authentication failures.

### Clustering

- [#14778](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14778) Fixed a bug where, if a running node had broken symlinks in its `data/certs` or `data/authz` directories, another node would fail to join it.
- [#14936](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14936) Resolved an issue where, in rare cases, the global routing table could indefinitely retain routing information for nodes that had long left the cluster.
- [#14977](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14977) Fixed `emqx ctl conf cluster_sync status` command node display order. Previously, the node name for new/old config was printed in the other way around.

### Cluster Linking

- [#15067](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15067) Fixed a couple of issues with Cluster Linking Route Replication.
  * Replication process may enter erratic reconnect loop when the Cluster Link is misconfigured on local or remote side, which will hinder replication once misconfiguration is resolved.
  * Replication process may crash during attempts to close non-existing MQTT client connection.
  * Replication boostrapping may crash if shared subscriptions are present in the routing table.

### Rule Engine

- [#14849](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14849) Removed an spurious field (`event_type`) from `POST /rule_test` responses. This was an internal field that doesn't actually appear in real events, so its presence in rule test outputs could be confusing.
- [#15056](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15056) For MQTT messages whose payload is a JSON list object, it is no longer necessary to explicitly decode the payload in the `foreach` statement.

### Smart Data Hub

- [#14988](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14988) Fixed an issue where Schema Validation or Message Transformation configurations could be imported before Schema Registry when restoring a backup, leading to validation errors.

### Data Integration

- [#14716](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14716) Adding and removing Actions/Sources is now done asynchronously outside of configuration changes. This means that the possibility of configuration and resource states diverging due to timeouts no longer can occur.

- [#14519](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14519) When (re)starting a node that's already configured with some Sources, it could happen that some transient warning logs could be logged because metrics were missing if said Sources started to receive traffic too soon. This has been fixed.

  Example of such logs:

  ```
  2025-01-08T07:48:36.421822+00:00 [warning] tag: RESOURCE, msg: handle_resource_metrics_failed, reason: {badkey,received}, stacktrace: ..., event: received, kind: error, hint: transient failures may occur when restarting a resource, resource_id: <<"source:mqtt:tset:connector:mqtt:test">>
  ```


- [#14992](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14992) Fixed a potential resource leak due to rare race conditions when testing connectivity of Connectors.

- [#15000](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15000) Fixed an issue where loading a configuration via CLI or HTTP API could cause instabilities in Connectors, Actions and/or Sources.

- [#15010](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15010) Previously, disabling any Connector could take about 5 to 10 s, even when it was healthy.  This has been fixed.  Note that some Connectors still naturally require time to disable, especially when they have Actions and when they are unhealthy.

- [#15051](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15051) Enhance the TDengine connector by adding parameter validation and updating the driver version to provide clearer error messages.

- [#15012](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15012) Fixed an issue where the `publish_confirmation_timeout` parameter of RabbitMQ Actions were being multiplied by 1000.

- [#14989](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14989) Reduced the number of API calls that Kinesis Connection and Action do when (re)starting and during health checks.

  Previously, upon (re)starting the Connector, it would perform one `ListStreams` request for each worker in its connection pool.  Additionally, each periodic health check would do `ListStreams` for each worker.  The Action health check would do `DescribeStream` for each connection worker in the pool.

  Now, the Connector no longer performs the initial `ListStreams` upon (re)starting.  Both Connector and Action attempt to check if at least one worker has a healthy response from their respective API requests: the request is attempted by each worker serially, and the Connector or Action is considered `connected` upon the first successful response received.  Thus, in the best case scenario, each Connector and each Action will do 1 API request each per health check, regardless of pool sizea.  In the worst case scenario, each worker in the pool might still perform one request each, if they fail to receive a sucessful response.

- [#14767](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14767) Kafka producer now smoothly handles Kafka topic re-creation with fewer partitions.
  Previously, the lost partition producers may linger behind to retry and write large amount of error logs.
  
- [#14121](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14121) Deprecated the `health_check_topic` configuration for Kafka Consumer Connector to avoid further confusion.  This parameter was never actually used for this connector type.

- [#15116](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15116) The Kafka connector now allows `topic_authorization_failed` as a valid response during health check probing. This change improved compatibility with Kafka services that enforce ACLs, where access to the default health-check topic may be restricted.

### Administration

- [#14931](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14931) The configuration `mqtt.max_qos_allowed` is now used as the granted subscription QoS and returned as the `reason code` in the **SUBACK** packet.
  Previously, the `reason code` in **SUBACK** packets was hard-coded to the subscription QoS instead of dynamically reflecting the granted QoS.
- [#14975](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14975) Fixed an issue preventing on-the-fly updates to certain TLS listener options, requiring a disable-enable cycle for changes to take effect.
- [#15037](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15037) Fixed rate limiting for dynamicalley created zones. Previously, the rate-limiting was not applied if a zone was created after the EMQX node was started.

### Configuration File

- [#15087](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15087) Fixed an issue with `hocon` library in which, if one had any string one-liner field that ended in a lone backslash, the configuration file would fail to be parsed later.

### Plugin and Extention

- [#15073](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15073) Added a validator for the server URL in the `exhook` configuration. This ensures that only valid URLs can be saved. Invalid URLs will now trigger an error and prevent being saved, which helps avoid issues during the import process, where previously invalid URLs could be accepted.

- [#14774](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14774) Resolved plugin related issues. Fixed a retrieval issue with the plugin configuration file from cluster nodes when initiating the plugin without an existing configuration file.

- [#14826](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14826) Fixed the issue where the Exhook server's return of "IGNORE" was not taking effect.

- [#15018](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15018) Fixed a bug with Exhook in which attemtping to import an invalid `exhook` configuration via the CLI would result in a crash with a `badarg` error.

- [#15108](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15108) ExHook now includes a built-in gRPC health check mechanism, ensuring that the connection status accurately reflects the actual availability of the external hook server.

  This fix addresses issues where the status could remain stale after the server was stopped for an extended time. Automatic reconnection is supported if enabled in the configuration.

### MQTT over QUIC

- [#14775](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14775) QUIC Listener: Fixed issue where zone configurations are not applied after a config reload.

## Breaking Changes

- [#14865](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14865) Dropped old LDAP authentication config layout (deprecated since v5.4).
  Move `password_attribute` and `is_superuser_attribute` under the `method` block:
    ```hcl
    method {
      type = hash
      password_attribute = "userPassword"
      is_superuser_attribute = "isSuperuser"
    }
    ```

- [#14765](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14765) Added extra validation for using Named Instances in SQL Server Connector.  Previously, we could not infer when the user furnished an explicit port for SQL Server, and always added the default port if not explicitly defined.

  For Named Instances, we need to explicitly define a port to connect to when connecting with the ODBC driver. And the driver happily connects to whatever instance is running on that port, completely ignoring the given Instance Name, if any.

  Now, we impose that the port is to be explicitly defined when an instance name is given, and we also attempt to infer differences between desired and connected instance names during health checks.

- [#14773](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14773) Rate limiting configuration options have been changed.
  - This change is incompatible with versions prior to 5.1.0
  - This change is also incompatible with manually modified limiter configurations that use structures from versions prior to 5.1.0
  - The undocumented endpoint `/configs/limiter` has been removed
  
- [#14703](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14703) Changed the maximum allowed value for `force_shutdown.max_heap_size` to `128GB`.

- [#14957](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14957) The way plugin configurations are updated has changed. The system now respects the result of the `on_config_changed` callback when updating a plugin's configuration. This change only affects new configuration updates made through the Dashboard. The result of the `on_config_changed` callback is still ignored for configurations that have already been stored in the cluster.

  Additionally, plugin apps are now loaded during plugin installation to ensure the `on_config_changed` callback is called even for stopped plugins.
