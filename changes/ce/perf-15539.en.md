Optimize Erlang VM parameters.

- Increase the buffer sizes for distributed channels to 32MB to avoid `busy_dist_port` alarms during intensive Mnesia operations: `+zdbbl 32768`
- Disable scheduler busy-waiting to reduce CPU usage observed by the operating system: `+sbwt none +sbwtdcpu none +sbwtdio none`
- Set scheduler binding type to `db` to reduce message latency: `+stbt db`
