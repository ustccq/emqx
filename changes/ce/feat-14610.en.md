Handle additional fields in authorization rules fetched from the external sources or stored in the built-in database.

The new supported fields are:
 `username_re` — a regex for filtering rules by username.
 `clientid_re` — a regex for filtering rules by clientid.
 `ipaddr` — an IP address/mask for filtering rules by IP address.

A rule is applied only if all the present filters match.
