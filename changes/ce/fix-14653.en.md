Fix stomp gateway keepalive.

Prior to this fix, stomp connection heatbeat cannot keep the connection alive if the heartbeat packet is received slightly later than the check timer.
This commit makes it to tolerate some delay, on average one can expect the connection close to happen around 1.5x heartbeat interval.
