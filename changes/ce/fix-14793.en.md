Add trace log for `protocol_error`.

Previously if a client sends invalid or unexpected MQTT packets to cause a `protocol_error` in EMQX, the detailed reason is not traced.
For example, if a client send two `CONNECT` packets, for the second one, EMQX may log `socket_force_closed` with `protocol_error`, but hard to tell why.
Now EMQX will log `unexpected_connect_packet` with `conn_state=connected` before `socket_force_closed`.
