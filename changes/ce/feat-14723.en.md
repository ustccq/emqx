Add `method` option to the Prometheus Push Gateway configuration. Before this change, the default value was `post`. Now, it is `put`.

The `put` method is used to replace the metrics of the same job in Pushgateway to avoid the metrics being retained in Pushgateway after being removed from the emqx cluster.

See the [PUT method](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway?tab=readme-ov-file#put-method) for more details.
