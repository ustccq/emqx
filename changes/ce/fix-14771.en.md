Fixed an issue where the number of results that the `GET /clients_v2` HTTP API returned could exceed the requested limit.

Note: while performing a rolling upgrade, this API may not list all existing clients until all nodes are migrated.  As a workaround, if HTTP API requests are issued to old core nodes, all clients can be listed before all nodes are fully upgraded.
