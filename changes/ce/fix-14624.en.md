Fix macOS release package dynamic linking openssl

EMQX zip package may fail to start on macOS because quicer application dynamic links to sys installed openssl which is not signed by 
EMQX build process.

Now we change to disabled dynamic linking as the OTP we shipped on macOS also disabled dynamic linking of openssl.
