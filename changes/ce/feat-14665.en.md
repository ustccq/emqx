Support client attribute as ACL rule pre-condition.

For example, below rule will alow clients with an attribute `"type"` of value `"internal"` to publish or subscribe all topics:
`{allow, {client_attr, "type", "internal"}, all, ["#"]}.`

And the rule below should deny all clients with an attribute `"type"` prefixed with `"external-"` to publish any message:
`{deny, {client_attr, "type", {re, "external-.*"}}, publish, ["#"]}.`
