The `packets.publish.dropped` metric was deprecated and replaced by two new, more semantic metrics: `messages.dropped.quota_exceeded` and `messages.dropped.receive_maximum`.  Those are bumped when a message is dropped due to an administrative quota limit being reached (more precisely, when a QoS 0 message is received by the broker and the client has exceeded its maximum [message rate limit](https://docs.emqx.com/en/emqx/latest/configuration/limiter.html#rate-limiter-configuration)) or the Receive Maximum for the session being reached while publishing a QoS 2 message, respectively.
