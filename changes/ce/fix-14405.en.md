Convert `256MB` to `268435455` bytes for `mqtt.max_packet_size`.

EMQX previously allowed setting `256MB` for `mqtt.max_packet_size` config, which is in fact one byte more than what the protocol spec allows.
For backward compatibility, `mqtt.max_packet_size=256MB` is still allowed from configurations, but will be silently converted to `268435455`.
