# e5.4.1

## Enhancements

- [#12261](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12261) The bridges for IoTDB have been split so it is available via the connectors and actions APIs. They are still backwards compatible with the old bridge API.

## Bug Fixes

- [#12234](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12234) Resolved compatibility issues with Open Telemetry configurations defined in `emqx.conf` from versions before EMQX 5.4.0, ensuring smooth integration of legacy configurations with the latest EMQX release.

- [#12236](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12236) Fixed client ID generation in MQTT broker data integration to comply with MQTT 3.1 specification of 23-byte limit. Client ID is now prefixed with user-assigned connector name, followed by the first 8 bytes of node name's SHA hash and pool member ID. If the resulting ID exceeds 23 bytes, additional SHA hash and truncation are applied to ensure compliance.

- [#12238](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12238) Resolved compatibility issue with the error format configurations introduced in the HTTP Action feature of EMQX version 5.3.2.

- [#12240](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12240) Modified the `/file_transfer` API to return file transfer configurations in their original raw format. This change prevents the conversion of time units, such as "1h", to seconds, ensuring that callers receive the initially configured values. This modification aligns with other getter APIs, maintaining consistency in data representation.

- [#12241](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12241) Fixed a bug where configuring additional HTTP headers for S3 API interactions disrupted file transfers using the S3 storage backend, ensuring stable and uninterrupted file transfer operations.

- [#12246](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12246) Stopped exposing port 11883 by default in Docker and removed it from Helm charts, as this port is no longer in use. 

- [#12249](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12249) Fixed an issue in the `/configs` API where attempting to modify a read-only configuration value resulted in a garbled response message.

- [#12250](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12250) Resolved an issue where the `file_transfer` configuration's `secret_access_key` value was erroneously being updated to masked stars (`*****`), ensuring that the original key value remains unaltered and secure.

- [#12256](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12256) Fixed an issue that prevented establishing connections to MySQL resources without a password.

- [#12264](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12264) Fix rolling upgrade when replica nodes join cluster with core nodes prior to version 5.4.
