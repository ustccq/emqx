# 5.10.0

*Release Date: 2025-06-10*

Make sure to check the breaking changes and known issues before upgrading to EMQX 5.10.0.

## Enhancements

- [#15348](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15348) Make `middlebox_comp_mode` configurable for SSL clients

  The `middlebox_comp_mode` option, which was previously always enabled (`true`) for all TLS 1.3 connections, is now configurable. By default, it remains `true` to maintain compatibility with most network environments.
  In rare cases where TLS fails with an error such as: "unexpected_message, TLS client: In state hello_retry_middlebox_assert ...", try set `middlebox_comp_mode` to `false`.

### Core MQTT Functionalities

- [#15118](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15118) Provided a new configuration option `mqtt.subscription_max_qos_rules` to control the maximum QoS level allowed per client subscription. This allows administrators to limit the QoS requested in SUBSCRIBE packets based on matching rules for specific topics. Currently, only a limited set of matching rules (predicates) is supported, based on the topic in the SUBSCRIBE packet.
- [#15246](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15246) Improved WebSocket connections performance and resource consumption.
    * Reduced CPU usage by approximately 20% and slightly lowered memory consumption, according to synthetic benchmarks measuring 1-on-1 MQTT messaging performance.
    * Improved connection setup efficiency when the listener-wide connection limit is enabled, especially on nodes managing a large number of connections.

### Deployment

- [#14791](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14791) Added support for custom annotations on the EMQX StatefulSet in the Helm chart, enabling automated pod restarts on ConfigMap or Secret changes. This improves automation and reliability when managing EMQX on Kubernetes.

### Access Control

- [#15250](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15250) Improved LDAP bind authentication to correctly extract the `is_superuser` flag from LDAP entry attributes.
  Previously, the `is_superuser` value was always set to `false`, even when the LDAP entry included a valid `isSuperuser` attribute.
- [#15249](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15249) Improved the LDAP authentication and authorization.

  * Validation for the LDAP `filter`/`base_dn` settings was added.
  * Fixed various variable interpolation issues.

### Rule Engine

- [#15001](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15001) Add `ai_completion` function to the Rule Engine SQL that allows to use AI services to process the data.

- [#15201](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15201) Add `base_url` option to AI completion provider configuration.

- [#15188](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15188) Rule event topics now have namespaces.

  | Previous event topic                    | New event topic                         |
  | :-------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- |
  | `$events/client_connected`              | `$events/client/connected`              |
  | `$events/client_disconnected`           | `$events/client/disconnected`           |
  | `$events/client_connack`                | `$events/client/connack`                |
  | `$events/client_check_authz_complete`   | `$events/auth/check_authz_complete`     |
  | `$events/client_check_authn_complete`   | `$events/auth/check_authn_complete`     |
  | `$events/session_subscribed`            | `$events/session/subscribed`            |
  | `$events/session_unsubscribed`          | `$events/session/unsubscribed`          |
  | `$events/message_delivered`             | `$events/message/delivered`             |
  | `$events/message_acked`                 | `$events/message/acked`                 |
  | `$events/message_dropped`               | `$events/message/dropped`               |
  | `$events/delivery_dropped`              | `$events/message/delivery_dropped`      |
  | `$events/message_transformation_failed` | `$events/message_transformation/failed` |
  | `$events/schema_validation_failed`      | `$events/schema_validation/failed`      |

  Previous event topics are kept for backwards compatibility.

- [#15175](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15175) Added support for matching event topics in Rule Engine using wildcards.  Now, it's possible to use `$events/#`, `$events/sys/+` and similar for matching multiple events at once.

### Smart Data Hub

- [#15174](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15174) Added support to upload Protobuf source file bundles for Schema Registry.

  For example, assuming that the Protobuf source file bundle is at `/tmp/bundle.tar.gz` and has the following file structure, with `a.proto` being the root Protobuf schema file:

  ```
  .
  ├── a.proto
  ├── c.proto
  └── nested
      └── b.proto
  ```

  Then, to create a new schema using that bundle via the HTTP API:

  ```sh
  curl -v http://127.0.0.1:18083/api/v5/schema_registry_protobuf/bundle \
    -XPOST \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer xxxx" \
    -F bundle=@/tmp/bundle.tar.gz \
    -F name=my_cool_schema \
    -F root_proto_file=a.proto
  ```

### Data Integration

- [#15248](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15248) EMQX supports data integration with [Doris](https://doris.apache.org/), supporting data writing using SQL statements.

- [#15218](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15218) Added support for IAM authentication in Kafka Producer and Consumer Connectors when connecting to Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka). When EMQX runs on AWS EC2, it uses the AWS SDK to generate OAuth Bearer tokens for Kafka clients.

- [#15157](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15157) Added support for specifying private key file path for Snowflake Connector instead of using password.

  Users should either use password, private key, or neither (set parameters in `/etc/odbc.ini`).

- [#14983](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/14983) EMQX supports data integration with S3Tables.

  **Current limitations**:
  - Only [S3Tables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/s3-tables.html) catalogs are supported (hence table data and metadata must live in S3).
  - Only [Iceberg table format version 2](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/#version-2-row-level-deletes) is supported.
  - Only the following partition transform functions are supported:
    - `identity`
    - `void`
    - `bucket[N]`
  - Data files are written only in [Avro](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.12.0/specification/).

- [#15331](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15331) Fixed the issue in influxdb action where the line protocol conversion failed when the `timestamp` in `WriteSyntax` was left blank and there was no timestamp field in the rule. Now the system's current millisecond value is used instead, and millisecond precision is enforced.

### Multi-Tenancy

- [#15253](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15253) Added two new multi-tenancy APIs: `GET /mt/ns_list_details` and `GET /mt/ns_list_managed_details`.  Both work similarly to their existing counterpars, but returns extra metadata associated with the namespace besides its name.
- [#15160](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15160) Added the `DELETE /mt/bulk_delete_ns` API for multi-tenancy management, which allows deleting namespaces in bulk.

### CLI

- [#15158](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15158) Added new `emqx ctl conf remove x.y.z` command, which removes the configuration key path `x.y.z` from the existing configuration.

### Gateway

- [#15138](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15138) Introduced NATS Gateway for accepting NATS client connections over TCP/TLS, WS/WSS transport protocols.

  For example, the NATS gateway will transform the following NATS message into an MQTT message with the topic `sub/t` and payload `hello`, while supporting seamless integration with existing EMQX features such as the rule engine, data integration, and more:
  ```
  PUB sub.t 5  
  hello
  ```

### Durable Storage

- [#15043](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15043) Instrument the DS Raft backend with basic metrics to provide insights into cluster status, database overview, shard replication, and replica transitions.

## Bug Fixes

### Access Control

- [#15184](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15184) Fixed an issue where the error message format was incorrect when creating a new banned list record failed.

### Clustering

- [#15304](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15304) Fixed the problem related to core node discovery by replicant nodes when using `static` discovery strategy.

  Previously, the replicants could ignore core nodes not explicitly listed in the `static_seeds` list.
  This could lead to an inconsistent cluster view and load imbalance.

- [#15180](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15180) Fixed an issue in `ekka_locker` where RPC (`badrpc`) errors were not handled correctly, causing false-positive lock successes. This could lead to inconsistent lock states and deadlocks in clustered deployments.

### Security

- [#15159](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15159) Improved CRL Distribution Point (CDP) handling: If a CDP URL fails to refresh continuously (default timeout: 60 seconds), it will now be evicted and excluded from further refresh attempts to prevent repeated error logs.

### Rule Engine

- [#15247](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15247) Fixed an issue where `function_clause` error logs would be printed when attempting to call `emqx ctl conf remove dashboard.sso.<BACKEND_NAME>`.

### Smart Data Hub

- [#15285](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15285) Added `content-type` header to External HTTP Schema requests.
- [#15224](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15224) Fixed an issue where updating an External Schema Registry via the dashboard would inadvertently change the password to `******`.
- [#15190](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15190) Support setting hard-coded QoS and topic in message transformation.

### Data Integration

- [#15274](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15274) Now, any health check failure for Postgres, Matrix and TimescaleDB Connectors will trigger a full reconnection.  Prior to this change, there were situations where the connection would become unusable and attempts to use it would hang, potentially leading to out of memory issues.

- [#15234](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15234) Added trace events for rule testing when either the Action is not installed yet, and for Republish Fallback actions.  These will now appear in the frontend while testing Rules with simulated input data.

- [#15219](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15219) Reduced the amount of logs generated by Clickhouse Connector when a health check timeout occurs.  Also, when a health check timeout occurs for this Connector, we now mark it as `connecting` instead of `disconnected`, meaning that a full reconnect attempt will no longer be triggered by such timeouts.

- [#15154](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15154) Fixed a rare race condition in Actions that run in aggregated mode (S3, Azure Blob Storage, Snowflake) that could result in crash logs similar to the following:

  ```
  ** Reason for termination ==
  ** {function_clause,[{emqx_connector_aggregator,handle_close_buffer,[...], ...
  ```

- [#15147](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15147) When running Rule tests with simulated input data, some Actions would not emit trace events after rendering requests.  This has been fixed.

  Affected Actions:
  - Couchbase
  - Snowflake
  - IoTDB (Thrift driver)

- [#15306](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15306) Fixed an issue where a Connector's health check response would always trigger health checks for all dependent Actions and Sources, regardless of their actual state.

### Multi-Tenancy

- [#15242](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15242) Fixed an issue where, upon node restart after configuring limiters for multi-tenancy, logs like the following would be logged while initializing limiters:

  ```
  2025-05-15T16:45:13.276895+08:00 [error] clientid: ns3mqttx_620053b2_100, msg: hook_callback_exception, peername: 127.0.0.1:39364, username: ns3, reason: {limiter_group_not_found,{mt_tenant,<<"ns3">>}}, stacktrace: [{emqx_limiter,connect,1,[{file,"emqx_limiter.erl"},{line,134}]}
  ```

### Observability

- [#15299](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15299) Fixed a `badarg` error when exporting OpenTelemetry metrics.

### Telemetry

- [#15216](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15216) Fixed a crash of `emqx_telemetry` process when there are plugins activated.

## Breaking Changes

- [#15289](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15289) Added a new `resource_opts.health_check_timeout` configuration to all Connectors, Actions and Sources, with default value of 60 seconds.  If a health check takes more than this to return a response, the Connector/Action/Source will be deemed `disconnected`.

  Note: since the default is 60 seconds, this means that if a Connector/Action/Source previously could take more than that to return a healthy response, now it'll be deemed disconnected in such situations.

- [#15286](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15286) Configuration option `broker.routing.storage_schema` is now deprecated and ignored. Legacy `v1` routing storage schema is no longer supported, and EMQX will refuse to start in a cluster running running older versions that still use it.

- [#15239](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15239) The type for the `multi_tenancy.default_max_sessions` is now either `infinity` or a positive integer.  Previously, `0` would be accepted.

- [#15156](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/15156) Schema validation was added to `dashboard.sso.oidc.issuer` field.  Now, this value is checked to be a valid URL.
