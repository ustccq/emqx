# v5.6.0

## Enhancements

- [#12251](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12251) Optimized the performance of the RocksDB-based persistent sessions, achieving a reduction in  RAM usage and database request frequency. Key improvements include:

  - Introduced dirty session state to avoid frequent mria transactions.
  - Introduced an intermediate buffer for the persistent messages.
  - Used separate tracks of PacketIds for QoS1 and QoS2 messages.
  - Limited the number of continuous ranges of inflight messages to 1 per stream.

- [#12326](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12326) Enhanced session tracking with registration history. EMQX now has the capability to monitor the history of session registrations, including those that have expired. By configuring `broker.session_history_retain`, EMQX retains records of expired sessions for a specified duration.

  - **Session count API**: Use the API `GET /api/v5/sessions_count?since=1705682238` to obtain a count of sessions across the cluster that remained active since the given UNIX epoch timestamp (with seconds precision). This enhancement aids in analyzing session activity over time.

  - **Metrics expansion with cluster sessions gauge**: A new gauge metric, `cluster_sessions`, is added to better track the number of sessions within the cluster. This metric is also integrated into Prometheus for easy monitoring:

    ```
    # TYPE emqx_cluster_sessions_count gauge
    emqx_cluster_sessions_count 1234
    ```

    NOTE: Please consider this metric as an approximate estimation. Due to the asynchronous nature of data collection and calculation, exact precision may vary.

- [#12338](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12338) Introduced a time-based garbage collection mechanism to the RocksDB-based persistent session backend. This feature ensures more efficient management of stored messages, optimizing storage utilization and system performance by automatically purging outdated messages.

- [#12398](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12398) Exposed the `swagger_support` option in the Dashboard configuration, allowing for the enabling or disabling of the Swagger API documentation.

- [#12467](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12467) Started supporting cluster discovery using AAAA DNS record type.


- [#12483](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12483) Renamed `emqx ctl conf cluster_sync tnxid ID` to `emqx ctl conf cluster_sync inspect ID`.

  For backward compatibility, `tnxid` is kept, but considered deprecated and will be removed in 5.7.

- [#12499](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12499) Enhanced client banning capabilities with extended rules, including:

  * Matching `clientid` against a specified regular expression.
  * Matching client's `username` against a specified regular expression.
  * Matching client's peer address against a CIDR range.

  **Important Notice**: Implementing a large number of broad matching rules (not specific to an individual clientid, username, or host) may affect system performance. It's advised to use these extended ban rules judiciously to maintain optimal system efficiency.

- [#12509](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12509) Implemented API to re-order all authenticators / authorization sources.

- [#12517](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12517) Configuration files have been upgraded to accommodate multi-line string values, preserving indentation for enhanced readability and maintainability. This improvement utilizes `"""~` and `~"""` markers to quote indented lines, offering a structured and clear way to define complex configurations. For example:

  ```
  rule_xlu4 {
    sql = """~
      SELECT
        *
      FROM
        "t/#"
    ~"""
  }
  ```

  See [HOCON 0.42.0](https://github.com/emqx/hocon/releases/tag/0.42.0) release notes for details.

- [#12520](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12520) Implemented log throttling. The feature reduces the volume of logged events that could potentially flood the system by dropping all but the first occurance of an event within a configured time window.
  Log throttling is applied to the following log events that are critical yet prone to repetition:

  - `authentication_failure`
  - `authorization_permission_denied`
  - `cannot_publish_to_topic_due_to_not_authorized`
  - `cannot_publish_to_topic_due_to_quota_exceeded`
  - `connection_rejected_due_to_license_limit_reached`
  - `dropped_msg_due_to_mqueue_is_full`

- [#12561](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12561) Implemented HTTP APIs to get the list of client's in-flight and message queue (mqueue) messages. These APIs facilitate detailed insights and effective control over message queues and in-flight messaging, ensuring efficient message handling and monitoring.

  To get the first chunk of data:

  - `GET /clients/{clientid}/mqueue_messages?limit=100`
  - `GET /clients/{clientid}/inflight_messages?limit=100`

  Alternatively, for the first chunks without specifying a start position:

  - `GET /clients/{clientid}/mqueue_messages?limit=100&position=none`
  - `GET /clients/{clientid}/inflight_messages?limit=100&position=none`

  To get the next chunk of data:

  - `GET /clients/{clientid}/mqueue_messages?limit=100&position={position}`
  - `GET /clients/{clientid}/inflight_messages?limit=100&position={position}`

  Where `{position}` is a value (opaque string token) of `meta.position` field from the previous response.

  Ordering and Prioritization:

  - **Mqueue Messages**: These are prioritized and sequenced based on their queue order (FIFO), from higher to lower priority. By default, mqueue messages carry a uniform priority level of 0.
  - **In-Flight Messages**: Sequenced by the timestamp of their insertion into the in-flight storage, from oldest to newest.

- [#12590](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12590) Removed `mfa` meta data from log messages to improve clarity.

- [#12641](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12641) Improved text log formatter fields order. The new fields order is as follows:

  `tag` > `clientid` > `msg` > `peername` > `username` > `topic` > [other fields]

- [#12670](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12670) Added field `shared_subscriptions` to endpoint `/monitor_current` and `/monitor_current/nodes/:node`.

- [#12679](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12679) Upgraded docker image base from Debian 11 to Debian 12.

- [#12700](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12700) Started supporting "b" and "B" unit in bytesize hocon fields. For example, all three fields below will have the value of 1024 bytes:

  ```
  bytesize_field = "1024b"
  bytesize_field2 = "1024B"
  bytesize_field2 = 1024
  ```

- [#12719](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12719) The `/clients` API has been upgraded to accommodate queries for multiple `clientid`s and `username`s simultaneously, offering a more flexible and powerful tool for monitoring client connections. Additionally, this update introduces the capability to customize which client information fields are included in the API response, optimizing for specific monitoring needs.

  Examples of Multi-Client/Username Queries:

  - To query multiple clients by ID: `/clients?clientid=client1&clientid=client2`
  - To query multiple users: `/clients?username=user11&username=user2`
  - To combine multiple client IDs and usernames in one query: `/clients?clientid=client1&clientid=client2&username=user1&username=user2`

  Examples of Selecting Fields for the Response:

  - To include all fields in the response: `/clients?fields=all` (Note: Omitting the `fields` parameter defaults to returning all fields.)
  - To specify only certain fields: `/clients?fields=clientid,username`

- [#12381](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12381) Added new SQL functions: `map_keys()`, `map_values()`, `map_to_entries()`, `join_to_string()`, `join_to_string()`, `join_to_sql_values_string()`, `is_null_var()`, `is_not_null_var()`.

  For more information on the functions and their usage, refer to [Built-in SQL Functions](../data-integration/rule-sql-builtin-functions) the documentation.

- [#12336](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12336) Refined the approach to managing asynchronous tasks by segregating the cleanup of channels into its own dedicated pool. This separation addresses performance issues encountered during channels cleanup under conditions of high network latency, ensuring that such tasks do not impede the efficiency of other asynchronous operations, such as route cleanup.

- [#12725](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12725) Implemented REST API to list the available source types.

- [#12746](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12746) Added `username` log field. If MQTT client is connected with a non-empty username the logs and traces will include `username` field.

- [#12785](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12785) Added `timestamp_format` configuration option to log handlers. This new option allows for the following settings:

  - `auto`: Automatically determines the timestamp format based on the log formatter being used.
    Utilizes `rfc3339` format for text formatters, and `epoch` format for JSON formatters.

  - `epoch`: Represents timestamps in microseconds precision Unix epoch format.

  - `rfc3339`: Uses RFC3339 compliant format for date-time strings. For example, `2024-03-26T11:52:19.777087+00:00`.

- [#12392](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12392)
  New WebSocket listener option: `validate_utf8` for performance tuning.

- [#12417](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12417) Added support for specifying the expiration time of MQTT messages via configuration file.

See the description of the `message_expiry_interval` configuration in the `mqtt.conf.example` file for more details.

## Bug Fixes

- [#11868](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/11868) Fixed a bug where will messages were not published after session takeover.

- [#12347](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12347) Implemented an update to ensure that messages processed by the Rule SQL for the MQTT egress data bridge are always rendered as valid, even in scenarios where the data is incomplete or lacks certain placeholders defined in the bridge configuration. This adjustment prevents messages from being incorrectly deemed invalid and subsequently discarded by the MQTT egress data bridge, as was the case previously.

  When variables in `payload` and `topic` templates are undefined, they are now rendered as empty strings instead of the literal `undefined` string.

- [#12472](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12472) Fixed an issue where certain read operations on `/api/v5/actions/` and `/api/v5/sources/` endpoints might result in a `500` error code during the process of rolling upgrades.

- [#12492](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12492) EMQX now returns the `Receive-Maximum` property in the `CONNACK` message for MQTT v5 clients, aligning with protocol expectations. This implementation considers the minimum value of the client's `Receive-Maximum` setting and the server's `max_inflight` configuration as the limit for the number of inflight (unacknowledged) messages permitted. Previously, the determined value was not sent back to the client in the `CONNACK` message.

- [#12500](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12500) The `GET /clients` and `GET /client/:clientid` HTTP APIs have been updated to include disconnected persistent sessions in their responses.

  NOTE: A current known issue with these enhanced API responses is that the total client count provided may exceed the actual number of clients due to the inclusion of disconnected sessions.

- [#12513](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12513) Changed the level of several flooding log events from `warning` to `info`.

- [#12530](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12530) Improved the error reporting for `frame_too_large` events and malformed `CONNECT` packet parsing failures. These updates now provide additional information, aiding in the troubleshooting process.

- [#12541](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12541) Introduced a new configuration validation step for autocluster by DNS records to ensure compatibility between `node.name` and `cluster.discover_strategy`. Specifically, when utilizing the `dns` strategy with either `a` or `aaaa` record types, it is mandatory for all nodes to use a (static) IP address as the host name.

- [#12562](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12562) Added a new configuration root: `durable_storage`. This configuration tree contains the settings related to the new persistent session feature.

- [#12566](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12566) Enhanced the bootstrap file for REST API keys:

  - Empty lines within the file are now skipped, eliminating the previous behavior of generating an error.

  - API keys specified in the bootstrap file are assigned the highest precedence. In cases where a new key from the bootstrap file conflicts with an existing key, the older key will be automatically removed to ensure that the bootstrap keys take effect without issue.

- [#12646](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12646) Fixed an issue with the rule engine's date-time string parser. Previously, time zone adjustments were only effective for date-time strings specified with second-level precision.

- [#12652](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12652) Fixed a discrepancy where the subbits functions with 4 and 5 parameters, despite being documented, were missing from the actual implementation. These functions have now been added.

- [#12663](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12663) Fixed an issue where the `emqx_vm_cpu_use` and `emqx_vm_cpu_idle` metrics, accessible via the Prometheus endpoint `/prometheus/stats`, were inaccurately reflecting the average CPU usage since the operating system boot. This fix ensures that these metrics now accurately represent the current CPU usage and idle, providing more relevant and timely data for monitoring purposes.

- [#12668](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12668) Refactored the SQL function `date_to_unix_ts()` by using `calendar:datetime_to_gregorian_seconds/1`.
  This change also added validation for the input date format.

- [#12672](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12672) Changed the process for generating the node boot configuration by incorporating the loading of `{data_dir}/configs/cluster.hocon`. Previously, changes to logging configurations made via the Dashboard and saved in `{data_dir}/configs/cluster.hocon` were only applied after the initial boot configuration was generated using `etc/emqx.conf`, leading to potential loss of some log segment files due to late reconfiguration.

  Now, both `{data_dir}/configs/cluster.hocon` and `etc/emqx.conf` are loaded concurrently, with settings from `emqx.conf` taking precedence, to create the boot configuration.

- [#12696](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12696) Fixed an issue where attempting to reconnect an action or source could lead to wrong error messages being returned in the HTTP API.

- [#12714](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12714) Fixed inaccuracies in several metrics reported by the `/prometheus/stats` endpoint of the Prometheus API. The correction applies to the following metrics:

  - `emqx_cluster_sessions_count`
  - `emqx_cluster_sessions_max`
  - `emqx_cluster_nodes_running`
  - `emqx_cluster_nodes_stopped`
  - `emqx_subscriptions_shared_count`
  - `emqx_subscriptions_shared_max`

  Additionally, this fix rectified an issue within the `/stats` endpoint concerning the `subscriptions.shared.count` and `subscriptions.shared.max` fields. Previously, these values failed to update promptly following a client's disconnection or unsubscription from a Shared-Subscription.

- [#12715](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12715) Fixed a crash that could occur during configuration updates if the connector for the ingress data integration source had active channels.

- [#12740](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12740) Fixed an issue when durable sessions could not be kicked out.

- [#12768](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12768) Addressed a startup failure issue in EMQX version 5.4.0 and later, particularly noted during rolling upgrades from versions before 5.4.0. The issue was related to the initialization of the routing schema when both v1 and v2 routing tables were empty.

  The node now attempts to retrieve the routing schema version in use across the cluster instead of using the v2 routing table by default when local routing tables are found empty at startup. This approach mitigates potential conflicts and reduces the chances of diverging routing storage schemas among cluster nodes, especially in a mixed-version cluster scenario. 

  If conflict is detected in a running cluster, EMQX writes instructions on how to manually resolve it in the log as part of the error message with `critical` severity. The same error message and instructions will also be written on standard error to make sure this message will not get lost even if no log handler is configured.

- [#12786](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12786) Added a strict check that prevents replicant nodes from connecting to core nodes running with a different version of EMQX application.
  This check ensures that during the rolling upgrades, the replicant nodes can only work when at least one core node is running the same EMQX release version.

## Breaking Changes

- [#12576](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12576) Starting from 5.6, the "Configuration Manual" document will no longer include the `bridges` config root.

  A `bridge` is now either `action` + `connector` for egress data integration, or `source` + `connector` for ingress data integration.
  Please note that the `bridges` config (in `cluster.hocon`) and the REST API path `api/v5/bridges` still works, but considered deprecated.

- [#12634](https://github.com/emqx/emqx/pull/12634) Triple-quote string values in HOCON config files no longer support escape sequence.

  The detailed information can be found in [this pull request](https://github.com/emqx/hocon/pull/290).
  Here is a summary of the impact on EMQX users:

  - EMQX 5.6 is the first version to generate triple-quote strings in `cluster.hocon`,
  meaning for generated configs, there is no compatibility issue.
  - For user hand-crafted configs (such as `emqx.conf`) a thorough review is needed
  to inspect if escape sequences are used (such as `\n`, `\r`, `\t` and `\\`), if yes,
  such strings should be changed to regular quotes (one pair of `"`) instead of triple-quotes.
