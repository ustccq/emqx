# Apache ElasticSearch Data Integration Bridge

This application houses the ElasticSearch data integration bridge for EMQX Enterprise
 Edition. It provides the means to connect to ElasticSearch and publish messages to it.

It implements the connection management and interaction without need for a
 separate connector app, since it's not used by authentication and authorization
 applications.
