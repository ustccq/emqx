# EMQX Disk Log Bridge

This application provides connector and action implementations for the EMQX to append data to rotating logs in the local filesystem as part of the EMQX data integration pipelines.
Users can leverage [EMQX Rule Engine](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/latest/data-integration/rules.html) to create rules that publish message data to disk log.

## Documentation

Refer to [Rules engine](https://docs.emqx.com/en/enterprise/latest/data-integration/rules.html) for the EMQX rules engine introduction.
