# Dashboard Role-Based Access Control

RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) is a common access control model for managing user access to systems, applications or resources.
In the RBAC model, access permissions are assigned and managed based on user roles instead of being directly associated with individual users,
making management and usage simpler.

This application houses the RBAC feature for Dashboard.
